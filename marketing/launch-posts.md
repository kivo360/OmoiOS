### Tagline (60 chars)
Describe a feature. Wake up to a PR.

### Short Description (260 chars)
Stop babysitting AI coding tools. OmoiOS turns your spec into a dependency graph, runs parallel agents in sandboxes, and constantly checks progress against your goal. Not "loop until done" — loop until the spec is satisfied. Wake up to shipped code.

### Maker Comment

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Kevin. I've spent months obsessing over one question: why do I spend more time checking on AI than actually working?

Continuous agents are powerful — they loop until the job is done. But without structure, they drift. They redo work. They don't know when they're *actually* done.

**So I built OmoiOS — AI that babysits itself.**

Here's how it works:

1. **Describe what you want** — even loosely. OmoiOS helps structure it into a spec.
2. **OmoiOS breaks it down** — Requirements → Design → Tasks with dependencies
3. **Parallel agents execute** — Multiple Claude agents working simultaneously in isolated sandboxes
4. **System constantly checks progress** — Are we closer to the goal? Is this task actually done?
5. **Wake up to a PR** — Everything traced back to your original intent

The key insight: **AI should babysit itself**. 

You shouldn't have to check in every 10 minutes. That's OmoiOS's job.

Pricing:
- Starter: Free (5 workflows/month)
- Pro: $299/month (50 workflows, 3 agents)
- Team: $999/month (unlimited workflows, 10 agents)
- Enterprise: Starting $5K/month

### Title
Show HN: OmoiOS – AI agents that babysit themselves so you don't have to

### Post
I've been building OmoiOS for the past few months. It's a spec-driven autonomous engineering platform.

The problem I kept running into with AI coding tools: I was spending more time checking on the AI than actually working. Continuous agents loop until done, but "done" is undefined. They drift. They redo work. They don't know if they're actually making progress.

OmoiOS adds the oversight layer:

1. You describe a feature (even loosely)
2. System generates structured spec: Requirements → Design → Tasks
3. Tasks form a dependency graph (DAG)
4. Multiple Claude agents execute in parallel sandboxes
5. Guardian system monitors trajectories every 60 seconds
6. Checks current state against spec to verify actual progress
7. Self-corrects when agents drift

The key difference vs other autonomous tools: full visibility. You see the DAG, you approve phase gates, every task traces back to requirements. It's not a black box.

Pricing: Free tier (5 workflows/month), Pro ($299/mo), Team ($999/mo), Enterprise (from $5K/mo).

Tech stack: FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Claude Agent SDK, Next.js 15.

Would love feedback from anyone who's tried autonomous coding tools. What made you stop using them?

**1/**
I was spending more time babysitting AI than actually working.

So I built AI that babysits itself.

Introducing OmoiOS — describe a feature, wake up to a PR.

Here's how it works 🧵

**2/**
The problem with AI coding tools:

They generate code. But they don't know:
- If it actually works
- If it matches what you wanted
- When they're actually done
- If they're going in circles

You end up checking in constantly. That's not automation.

**3/**
OmoiOS is different.

You describe what you want → System creates a spec → Breaks it into tasks with dependencies → Multiple agents execute in parallel → Guardian monitors progress → You wake up to a PR.

**4/**
The spec-driven approach:

Requirements → Design → Tasks → Execution

Every line of code traces back to a requirement. If something breaks, you know exactly what it was supposed to do.

No more "the AI did something and I don't know why."

**5/**
Parallel execution:

Not a for-loop. A dependency graph.

Independent tasks run simultaneously. Blocked tasks wait. When one completes, dependents automatically start.

10 agents working at once > 1 agent working sequentially.

**6/**
The Guardian system:

Every 60 seconds, OmoiOS checks:
- Are agents making progress?
- Are they drifting from the goal?
- Are they stuck in loops?
- Did they actually complete the task?

If something's wrong, it intervenes. You don't have to.

**7/**
Full visibility:

- See the dependency graph
- Watch agents work in real-time
- Approve phase transitions
- Review PRs with full context

It's not a black box. You know exactly what's happening.

**8/**
Who it's for:

- CTOs tired of hiring faster than shipping
- Senior engineers who want to 10x output
- Startups that need to move fast
- Anyone who's tried AI coding tools and gave up

**9/**
Pricing:

🆓 Starter: Free, 5 workflows/month
💜 Pro: $299/mo, 50 workflows, 3 agents
🚀 Team: $999/mo, unlimited workflows, 10 agents
🏢 Enterprise: From $5K/mo

## LinkedIn Post

I've been working on something for months and it's finally ready.

**The problem:** Every AI coding tool I tried required constant babysitting. Check in every 10 minutes. Fix the drift. Restart when it loops. Verify it actually did what I asked.

That's not automation. That's a different kind of manual work.

**The insight:** AI should babysit itself.

**The solution:** OmoiOS

It's a spec-driven autonomous engineering platform. You describe a feature, the system creates a structured plan (Requirements → Design → Tasks), multiple AI agents execute in parallel, and a Guardian system monitors everything to ensure actual progress.

You wake up to a pull request.

What makes it different:
• Full visibility — see the dependency graph, watch agents work
• Spec-driven — every task traces back to requirements
• Self-healing — Guardian intervenes when agents drift
• Parallel execution — 10 agents working simultaneously

We're live now:
• Starter: Free (5 workflows/month)
• Pro: $299/month
• Team: $999/month
• Enterprise: Custom pricing

If you've ever been frustrated by AI coding tools that need constant supervision, this is for you.

**Title:** I built an AI coding platform that babysits itself so I don't have to

**Post:**
Hey everyone,

I've been working on OmoiOS for a few months. It started because I was frustrated — every AI coding tool I tried needed constant checking. "Is it still working? Did it drift? Is it looping?"

OmoiOS is spec-driven:
1. You describe a feature
2. System creates spec (Requirements → Design → Tasks)
3. Tasks form a dependency graph
4. Multiple agents execute in parallel
5. Guardian system monitors and intervenes when needed
6. You get a PR

The Guardian checks every 60 seconds: are we making progress toward the goal? If agents drift, it course-corrects.

Stack: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Claude Agent SDK, Next.js 15

Pricing: Free tier, Pro ($299/mo), Team ($999/mo)

Would love feedback, especially from anyone who's tried other autonomous coding tools. What worked? What didn't?

### r/artificial

**Title:** Built a self-monitoring AI agent system that reduces the "babysitting problem"

**Post:**
One of the biggest issues with autonomous AI agents is they need constant human oversight. They drift, they loop, they don't know when they're actually done.

I built OmoiOS to address this with a few key mechanisms:

**1. Spec-driven execution**
Instead of open-ended "do this task," agents work from structured specs with explicit requirements and acceptance criteria. They know what "done" means.

**2. Dependency-aware parallel execution**
Tasks form a DAG. Independent work runs in parallel. Agents don't step on each other.

**3. Guardian monitoring**
Every 60 seconds, a separate system analyzes agent trajectories:
- Alignment with goals
- Progress toward completion
- Constraint violations
- Stuck/loop detection

When issues are detected, it sends targeted interventions.

**4. State verification**
After each task, system verifies the actual state matches expected state. Not just "did it run without errors" but "did it actually achieve the goal."

The result: you can describe a feature, walk away, and come back to a PR.

Still early, but the approach is working. Curious what other approaches people have seen for reducing agent oversight burden.

### r/startups

**Title:** Launched my AI coding platform today — here's what I learned building it

**Post:**
Just launched OmoiOS — an autonomous engineering platform. Describe a feature, get a PR.

**The journey:**

Started because I was frustrated. Every AI coding tool needed me to check in constantly. That's not automation, that's a different flavor of work.

Key insight: AI should babysit itself.

**What I built:**
- Spec-driven workflow (Requirements → Design → Tasks)
- Parallel agent execution
- Guardian system that monitors progress and intervenes
- Full visibility into what's happening

**Pricing decisions:**

Originally had it at $50/mo for Pro. Realized that's toy pricing if the tool actually works. Repriced to $299/mo Pro, $999/mo Team.

If you're saving engineering time, $299/mo is nothing. If you're not, the tool doesn't work anyway.

**What's next:**

Focus on enterprise. That's where the real pain (and budget) is.

Would love to connect with other founders building AI dev tools. What are you seeing in the market?
