## Outreach Templates

### Cold Email #1 (Problem-Aware)

**Subject:** Re: engineering hiring

Hi [Name],

Saw you're hiring [X] engineers. That usually means the roadmap is outpacing the team.

What if you could ship like a team twice your size without the hiring?

OmoiOS is autonomous engineering — describe a feature, wake up to a PR. Multiple AI agents work in parallel while a Guardian system ensures they actually make progress.

Companies like [similar company] are using it to ship [X] features per week with a team of [Y].

Worth a 15-min demo? I can show you a feature going from spec to PR in real-time.

### Cold Email #2 (Curious)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]'s roadmap

Hi [Name],

Curious — how do you handle the backlog of "nice to have" features that never get prioritized?

I built OmoiOS because I was tired of features dying in the backlog. It's autonomous engineering: describe what you want, AI agents build it overnight, you review the PR in the morning.

Not a code assistant. Full autonomous execution with oversight.

If this sounds interesting, I'd love 15 minutes to show you how it works.

### LinkedIn Connection Request

Building AI dev tools + saw your work at [Company]. Would love to connect and share ideas.

### LinkedIn Message (After Connect)

Hey [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Quick question — how's [Company] handling the balance between shipping fast and maintaining quality?

I ask because I built OmoiOS to help with exactly that. It's autonomous engineering: you describe features, AI agents execute in parallel, and a Guardian system ensures they're actually making progress.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I can show a feature going from idea to PR in real-time.
