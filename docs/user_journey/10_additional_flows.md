## Additional Flows & Edge Cases

### Error Handling & Failure Recovery

#### Agent Failure Scenarios

**Task Execution Failure:**
```
Agent fails to complete task:
   ↓
1. System detects failure (timeout, exception, test failure)
   ↓
2. Automatic retry logic:
   - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s + jitter)
   - Maximum retry attempts (configurable)
   - Error classification (retryable vs permanent)
   ↓
3. If retryable:
   - Agent retries with updated context
   - Guardian may provide intervention
   ↓
4. If permanent failure:
   - Task marked as failed
   - Discovery created (type: "bug" or "clarification_needed")
   - User notified
   - Option to spawn new task or update requirements
```

**Agent Stuck Detection:**
```
Agent stops responding:
   ↓
1. Heartbeat timeout (90s without heartbeat)
   ↓
2. System marks agent as "stuck"
   ↓
3. Guardian analyzes trajectory:
   - Checks alignment score
   - Reviews recent actions
   - Determines intervention needed
   ↓
4. Guardian sends intervention:
   - "[GUARDIAN INTERVENTION] Please provide status update"
   ↓
5. If no response:
   - Agent marked as failed
   - Task reassigned to new agent
   - Original agent's work preserved
```

**Spec Generation Failure:**
```
AI fails to generate spec:
   ↓
1. User sees error message:
   - "Unable to generate spec. Please try again or provide more details."
   ↓
2. Options:
   - Retry with same input
   - Provide more context
   - Use manual spec creation
   ↓
3. System logs error for analysis
   ↓
4. User can contact support if persistent
```

   ↓
2. User B reviews → Approves
   ↓
3. System shows:
   - Both reviews visible
   - Approval status: "1 approve, 1 request changes"
   - Requires all approvers to approve

**Comments & Collaboration:**
```
Agent/User adds comment to ticket:
   ↓
1. Opens ticket detail → Comments tab
   ↓
2. Types comment in rich text editor:
   - "@worker-2 please review this approach"
   - Attaches file if needed
   - Selects comment type (general, status_change, resolution)
   ↓
3. Posts comment:
   - Comment saved to database
   - WebSocket: COMMENT_ADDED event broadcast
   ↓
4. Real-time updates:

   ↓
5. @worker-2 receives notification:
   - Clicks link → Goes to ticket
   - Sees comment highlighted

   ↓
6. Agent replies via MCP tool:
   - add_ticket_comment() called
   - WebSocket: COMMENT_ADDED event
   - User sees agent reply in real-time
```

**Ticket Search Before Creation:**
```
Agent needs to create ticket:
   ↓
1. Before creating, searches for existing tickets:
   - Opens search modal (Cmd+K or Search button)
   - Types: "authentication JWT login"
   - Selects hybrid search (70% semantic + 30% keyword)
   ↓
2. Reviews search results:
   - System shows similar tickets
   - Agent checks if duplicate exists
   ↓
3a. If similar ticket found:
   - References existing ticket instead
   - Links current task to existing ticket
   ↓
3b. If no similar ticket:
   - Proceeds to create new ticket
   - Uses create_ticket MCP tool
   ↓
4. New ticket appears on board:
   - WebSocket: TICKET_CREATED event
   - Board updates in real-time
   - Ticket visible to all users immediately
```

**Ticket Creation with Blocking Relationships:**
```
Agent creates ticket with dependencies:
   ↓
1. Opens Create Ticket modal:
   - Fills title: "Build Authentication System"
   - Adds description
   - Selects ticket type: "component"
   - Sets priority: "HIGH"
   ↓
2. Sets blocking relationships:
   - Searches for blocking tickets
   - Selects: "Setup Database Schema" (blocker)
   - System shows dependency graph preview
   ↓
3. Creates ticket:
   - Ticket created with blocked_by_ticket_ids
   - Ticket status: "blocked" (overlay)
   - WebSocket: TICKET_CREATED + TICKET_BLOCKED events
   ↓
4. Real-time updates:
   - Ticket appears on board with blocked indicator
   - Dependency graph updates automatically
   - When blocker resolves → Auto-unblock via WebSocket
```

**Status Transitions with Agent Updates:**
```
Agent moves ticket through workflow:
   ↓
1. Agent completes implementation:
   - Calls change_ticket_status() MCP tool
   - New status: "building-done"
   - Comment: "Implementation complete. 8 test cases added."
   ↓
2. System validates transition:
   - Checks valid state machine transition
   - Validates phase gate criteria
   ↓
3. Status updated:
   - Ticket status changed in database
   - WebSocket: TICKET_UPDATED event broadcast
   ↓
4. Real-time board updates:
   - Ticket moves to new column automatically
   - All users see movement instantly
   - Activity timeline shows status change
   ↓
5. User manually transitions:
   - Opens ticket → Clicks "Move Ticket"
   - Selects new status: "testing"
   - Adds reason: "Ready for test phase"
   - Confirms transition
   ↓
6. System updates:
   - Status changed
   - WebSocket: TICKET_UPDATED event
   - Board reflects change immediately
```

**Blocking Management & Auto-Unblocking:**
```
Ticket blocked by dependencies:
   ↓
1. Ticket "Build Auth" blocked by "Setup DB":
   - Shows blocked indicator on board
   - Dependency graph shows blocking relationship
   ↓
2. Agent working on blocker:
   - Completes "Setup DB" ticket
   - Resolves ticket via resolve_ticket() MCP tool
   ↓
3. System detects blocker resolution:
   - Checks all tickets blocked by resolved ticket
   - Finds "Build Auth" ticket
   ↓
4. Auto-unblocking:
   - Updates blocked_by_ticket_ids (removes resolved blocker)
   - Sets is_blocked = false
   - WebSocket: TICKET_UNBLOCKED event broadcast
   ↓
5. Real-time updates:
   - "Build Auth" ticket unblocked indicator removed
   - Ticket becomes available for agents
   - Dependency graph updates (edge turns green)
   - Activity timeline shows unblock event
   ↓
6. Agent picks up unblocked ticket:
   - Sees ticket available in board
   - Starts working on it
   - WebSocket: TASK_ASSIGNED event
```

**Board Configuration:**
```
User configures board structure:
   ↓
1. Opens Project Settings → Board tab
   ↓
2. Configures columns:

3. Task dependencies satisfied
4. WIP limits not exceeded
   ↓
Solutions:
- Spawn new agent
- Manually assign task
- Check agent logs
- Contact support
```

**Spec Generation Slow:**
```
Issue: Spec takes > 5 minutes to generate
   ↓
Possible causes:
- Large codebase analysis
