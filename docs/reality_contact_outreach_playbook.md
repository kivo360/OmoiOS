# Reality-Contact Outreach Playbook (2 Weeks)

**Created**: 2025-12-15  
**Owner**: Founder  
**Purpose**: Increase contact with reality by forcing external, falsifiable outcomes: repo access → PR opened → PR merged → repeat ticket → paid pilot.

---

## The goal (what “progress” means)

### Reality ladder (signal strength)
1. Reply from a real ICP
2. Call booked
3. Repo access granted (or sandbox repo provided)
4. Ticket agreed (clear success criteria)
5. PR opened
6. PR merged
7. Ticket #2 requested within 14 days
8. Paid pilot accepted

### Two-week targets (aggressive but doable)
- **Outbound volume**: 60–120 cold touches total (email/forms + warm intros + GitHub contacts)
- **Calls**: 6–10
- **Repo access attempts**: 3–6
- **PRs opened**: 2–4
- **PRs merged**: 1–3
- **Pilot asks**: 2–4
- **Paid pilots**: 0–2 (early is lumpy; focus on merges + repeats)

## The scoreboard (track daily)
Copy this block into Notes and update once/day:

- **Touches sent**: ___

- **Repo access granted**: ___
- **Tickets agreed**: ___
- **PRs opened**: ___
- **PRs merged**: ___
- **Ticket #2 requested**: ___

### Leading indicators (should move in 48 hours)
- Touches sent, reply rate, calls booked.

### Reality indicators (should move in 7–14 days)
- Repo access rate, PR merge rate, repeat ticket rate, paid pilot yes/no.

---

## Operating rules (so you actually learn)

- **One wedge only for 2 weeks**: pick *one* ticket type you can reliably ship (e.g., integrations, internal tool endpoints, well-bounded backend feature with tests). Decline everything else.
- **One demo script**: same story, same scope, same acceptance criteria.
- **Always ask for the next falsifiable step**: repo access or sandbox repo, plus a ticket.
- **Always ask for merge**: “Will you merge this PR? If not, what would need to change?”
- **Always ask for ticket #2** right after merge: “Want me to take one more this week?”
- **Money ask is mandatory** after the first successful merge: “I can do a 30‑day pilot for $X with a cap. Yes/no?”

---

## 2-week calendar (minimal, repeatable)

### Day 1 (set up + list building)
- Choose your **wedge** (one sentence).
- Create a list of **30 targets** for ONE approach (2A/2B/2C) + 10 backups.
- Prepare: short Loom or 2–4 screenshots showing the “ticket → PR” path (optional but helpful).

### Days 2–4 (outreach burst)
- Send **10 touches/day**.
- Book calls and schedule them within **48 hours**.

### Days 5–7 (deliver PR #1)
- Convert one call into repo access + ticket.
- Deliver **PR #1 within 72 hours**.
- Ask for merge + collect the reason if no.

### Week 2 (repeat + monetize)
- Repeat the loop with a second org (PR #2).
- After any merge: ask for ticket #2 and a paid pilot.

## Approach 2A: Agencies / fractional CTOs (fastest “yes”)

### Why this is high leverage
- One agency can introduce multiple repos/clients.
- They value “delivery throughput” and can tolerate concierge execution.

### Where to find them
- Google: “software development agency”, “product studio”, “fractional CTO”, “MVP development” + your region.
- Clutch / GoodFirms directories.
- Their websites usually list an email or contact form.

### Target filter
- They build B2B SaaS/web apps.
- They mention GitHub/CI/testing/DevOps.
- They publish case studies (means process maturity).

### Outreach template (email/contact form)
Subject: I’ll ship 1 PR in a client repo this week

Body:
Hi {{name}} — I’m building OmoiOS: it turns a well-scoped ticket into a reviewed PR (with gates/visibility).

If you can share one small ticket (client repo or a sandbox repo), I’ll deliver 1 PR this week so you can judge code quality and review effort.

If it’s useful, we can make it a repeatable “PR delivery pipeline” for your client work.

Open to a 15‑min call?
— {{you}}

### Call agenda (15 minutes)
- Confirm their typical stack + repo process.
- Ask for one of:
  - sandbox repo access today, or
  - a client repo intro, or
  - a paid pilot after one merged PR.
- Pick a ticket that fits your wedge.
- Define success: “PR opened, CI green, reviewable diff.”

### What “progress” looks like (2A)
- **1–2 calls** from 20 touches is solid.
- **1 sandbox repo** within week 1.
- **1 client intro** within week 2.

---

## Approach 2B: GitHub-first outreach (pre-filters for PR culture)

### Why this works
You’re selecting for the behavior you need: PR review, tests, and engineering maturity.

### How to find targets
- Look for:
  - active repos with CI badges,
  - frequent PRs,
  - CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY files,
  - a company behind the repo.

### How to find contacts
- `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY`, `SUPPORT` (emails/links)
- Company website “Contact” / “Careers” page (often lists leadership)

### Outreach template (email)
Subject: Can I ship one PR in your repo to prove this?

Body:
Hi {{name}} — I’m building OmoiOS: it turns a well-scoped ticket into a reviewed PR (with gates/visibility).

If you’re open to it, I’d like to take one small issue/ticket and deliver a PR end-to-end this week so you can judge quality and review effort.

If it doesn’t save time or the PR isn’t mergeable, we stop—no hard feelings.

Worth a 15‑min call?
— {{you}}

### What “progress” looks like (2B)
- Reply rates can be lower, but **repo access quality** is higher.
- Win condition: **one repo access** + a ticket you can ship quickly.

---

## Approach 2C: Warm intros (highest conversion)

### The ask (send to 20 people)
“Do you know a CTO/EM who owns shipping at a 10–100 person engineering org? I’m trying to ship 1 PR/week in real repos for 2 weeks to validate something. Intro would help a lot.”

### Follow-up once you get an intro
- Immediately propose two times.
- Reuse the same 15‑minute agenda.

### What “progress” looks like (2C)
- Even **3–5 intros** is a big week.
- Warm intros should convert to repo access faster than cold.

---

## Follow-up sequence (works for all approaches)

### If no reply (48 hours)
“Quick bump — still open to letting me ship 1 PR in a repo this week? If not, no worries.”

### If “interesting” but vague
“Totally—best next step is 15 minutes to pick one small ticket. If I can’t open a PR within 72 hours, it’s a fail on my side.”

### If “not ready”
“No problem. Is there a quarter when you’ll be under the most delivery pressure? I can follow up then.”

## Converting learning into decisions (end of each week)

Answer these with numbers, not vibes:
- Where did people drop? (reply → call → repo → ticket → merge)
- What objections repeated?
- What failed most? (repo access, unclear tickets, CI failures, reviewability)

Then make exactly one decision:
- **Double down** on the approach with the best reality indicators (repo access + merges), and drop the rest for week 3.
