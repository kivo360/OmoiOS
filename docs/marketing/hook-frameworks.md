Hooks are the most important part of any piece of content. These 8 frameworks give you a proven structure to grab attention and keep readers engaged.

---

## 1. The Extreme Hook

Use extremes to grab attention, then overdeliver on value.

**Structure:**
```
[Extreme claim] → [Deliver on it]
```

**Example:**
> "The most underrated skill in business isn't what you think..."

**Why it works:** Extremes (best, biggest, smartest, most underrated) pattern-interrupt and create curiosity. Just make sure you actually deliver on the promise.

**Variations:**
- "The biggest mistake..."
- "The fastest way to..."
- "The only thing that matters..."

## 2. The AIDA Hook

Classic direct response formula: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

**Structure:**
```
Attention: [Pattern interrupt or bold claim]
Interest: [Relevant context that builds curiosity]
Desire: [Show what's possible / paint the outcome]
Action: [Clear next step]
```

**Example:**
> **Attention:** "I made $50K last month from a product I built in a weekend."
> **Interest:** "It started as a side project while I was still employed full-time."
> **Desire:** "Now I work 4 hours a day from anywhere in the world."
> **Action:** "Here's exactly how I did it (thread):"

**Why it works:** Walks readers through a logical progression from "huh?" to "I want that" to "show me how."

## 3. The PAS Hook

Problem → Agitate → Solution

**Structure:**
```
Problem: [State the pain they feel]
Agitate: [Make it worse, show consequences]
Solution: [Introduce your answer]
```

**Example:**
> **Problem:** "You're working 60+ hour weeks but still behind on every deadline."
> **Agitate:** "Your team is frustrated. Your family barely sees you. And no matter how hard you try, the backlog keeps growing."
> **Solution:** "What if one change could cut your workload in half?"

**Why it works:** Meets readers where they are (in pain), validates that pain, then offers hope.

## 4. The BAB Hook

Before → After → Bridge (transformation stories)

**Structure:**
```
Before: [Where they are now / the struggle]
After: [Where they could be / the transformation]
Bridge: [How to get there]
```

**Example:**
> **Before:** "6 months ago, I was burning out trying to do everything myself."
> **After:** "Today, I have 3 AI agents handling 80% of my repetitive work."
> **Bridge:** "Here's the exact system I use:"

**Why it works:** Paints a vivid picture of transformation and positions you as the guide who can help them get there.

## 5. The Emotional Hook

Hook → Context → Intrigue → Incentive

**Structure:**
```
Hook: [Emotional trigger / vulnerability]
Context: [Background that builds credibility]
Intrigue: [Create curiosity about what comes next]
Incentive: [Reason to keep reading]
```

**Example:**
> **Hook:** "I almost quit tech last year."
> **Context:** "After 10 years of building products, I was completely burned out."
> **Intrigue:** "Then I discovered something that changed everything."
> **Incentive:** "It's counterintuitive, but it might change how you think about work."

**Why it works:** Emotional hooks create connection. Vulnerability builds trust. The intrigue-to-incentive path keeps them reading.

---

## 6. The Results Hook

Results → Timeframe → Lessons

**Structure:**
```
Results: [Specific, impressive outcome]
Timeframe: [When/how long it took]
Lessons: [What you learned / will share]
```

**Example:**
> **Results:** "I went from 0 to 10,000 followers."
> **Timeframe:** "In 90 days."
> **Lessons:** "Here are the 7 things I'd do differently if I started over:"

**Why it works:** Specific numbers build credibility. Timeframes make it tangible. Lessons promise actionable value.

**Pro tip:** Use real numbers. "10,247 followers" is more believable than "10,000 followers."

---

## 7. The Client Hook

Use social proof and testimonials to build trust.

**Structure:**
```
Client result: [Specific outcome for a customer/client]
Context: [Who they were, what they struggled with]
Transformation: [What changed]
```

**Example:**
> "My client was spending 4 hours/day on email."
> "She's a startup founder juggling 3 products and a team of 12."
> "After implementing this system, she's down to 45 minutes."

**Why it works:** Other people's results are more believable than your own claims. Specific details make it real.

**Variations:**
- Screenshot of a testimonial
- Before/after metrics
- Direct quote from customer

---

## 8. The Idea Hook

Simple one-liners. Save what works and reuse.

**Structure:**
```
[Observation] + [Twist/Insight]
```

**Examples:**
> "The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing."

> "Most people overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can do in a year."

> "Your competition isn't other businesses. It's your customer's status quo."

> "The goal isn't to be busy. It's to be effective."

**Why it works:** One-liners are shareable, memorable, and position you as someone with insight.

**How to develop:**
1. Keep a swipe file of one-liners you like
2. Note what makes them work
3. Adapt the structure to your domain
4. Test them as hooks on longer content
