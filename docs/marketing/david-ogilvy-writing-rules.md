Legendary marketer David Ogilvy generated over $864 million for his clients. He was a British advertiser known as "The Father of Advertising."

## The 1982 Memo

In 1982, Ogilvy sent this 1-page memo to his staff, starting with a clear promise:

> "The better you write, the higher you will go in Ogilvy & Mather. People who think well, write well. Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well."

Replace "Ogilvy & Mather" with any company, and this holds true.

## The 10 Rules

### 1. Read the Roman-Raphelson book on writing. Read it 3 times.

Every company on Earth would be a better place if this book was required reading.

If you are still sending emails with Walls of Text, read this.

### 2. Write the way you talk. Naturally.

"Finding your writing voice" is a waste of time.

You already have your voice—the one you use every day.

**How to start using it in your writing:**
1. Choose a topic
2. Record yourself talking about it
3. Transcribe it and start there

### 3. Use short words, sentences, and paragraphs.

This one takes practice.

The easiest way to find when you're being too wordy: **Read everything aloud before you publish it.**

When you find yourself getting caught up, it's a sign you need to simplify.

### 4. Never use jargon.

When someone uses jargon, they're hiding their lack of understanding.

Instead, pretend you are writing to an 8th grader.

### 5. Never write more than 2 pages on any subject.

- 99% of books should be blog posts.
- 99% of blog posts should be LinkedIn posts.

**Key insight:** Never *publish* more than two pages on any subject. If it can't fit in two pages, it should be simpler.

### 6. Check your quotations.

Simple enough. Verify before you publish.

### 7. Never send a letter or memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning, then edit it.

This is the number one piece of writing advice.

If you are publishing something important, always give it room to breathe. And always read it aloud.

### 8. If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.

Pairs nicely with point number 7.

**The process for important writing:**
1. Write it
2. Give it a day
3. Edit it
4. Send it to a colleague

### 9. Before you send your letter or memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.

Simple, but easy to forget.

Put yourself in the reader's shoes and identify exactly the next step they should take after reading. Then, articulate those steps for them.

### 10. If you want ACTION, don't write. Go tell the guy what you want.

Last and most importantly: **writing is never a replacement for a targeted conversation.**

Most messages should be conversations, especially ones that require action.
