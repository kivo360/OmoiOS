# I Was Wrong About the Hate

*Theme: Launch Day / Fear vs Reality / Emotional Release*

## Raw Version (X, Reddit)

I launched on Product Hunt today.

For weeks, I've been writing about the fear. The voice that says "people are going to hate you." The spiral of "it's not ready." The mental warfare of shipping something imperfect.

I hit publish. I braced myself.

Then someone found my account. Someone I didn't know. And they just... gave me love. "Congrats on the launch." Pure support. No judgment. No hate.

And I fucking broke down.

I'm talking tears. Real ones. The kind you don't expect.

All those weeks of "people are going to hate me." All that mental agony. All that fear of judgment.

And the first real feedback I got was kindness.

I was wrong.

The hate I was so afraid of? It was mostly in my own head. The audience I imagined tearing me apart? They were rooting for me.

I don't know if this product will succeed. I don't know if the numbers will be good. But I know this:

The fear was a liar.

If you're holding back because you think people will hate you: you're probably wrong too.

Ship it. Find out.

## Polished Version (LinkedIn, Indie Hackers)

I launched today.

For weeks leading up to this, I've been processing the fear. The internal voice predicting harsh judgment. The anxiety about putting imperfect work into the world.

I published. I prepared for criticism.

What I received was support. Someone reached out with genuine congratulations. Pure encouragement. No conditions attached.

I got emotional. More than I expected.

All those weeks of anticipating negativity. All that energy spent on worst-case scenarios. All that fear of how people would respond.

And the first real interaction was kindness.

The fear, it turns out, was mostly internal. The critical audience I imagined didn't materialize. People were supportive.

I don't know yet whether this will succeed commercially. The metrics will take time.

But I learned something important: the fear was disproportionate to reality.

If you're delaying because you expect hostility — consider that you might be wrong.

The audience is often kinder than we imagine.
