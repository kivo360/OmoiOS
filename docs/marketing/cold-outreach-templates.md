## The Psychology of Cold Outreach

Cold outreach is harder than warm because you have no relationship capital. You must earn attention in 3 seconds.

**What makes cold outreach work:**
1. **Relevance** - Shows you researched them specifically
2. **Brevity** - Respects their time (under 100 words ideal)
3. **Curiosity** - Opens a loop they want to close
4. **Low ask** - Not "buy my thing" but "quick question"
5. **Clear value** - What's in it for them?

**What kills cold outreach:**
1. **Generic** - "Dear Sir/Madam" or clearly templated
2. **Long** - More than 5-6 sentences
3. **Self-focused** - "I built... I want... I need..."
4. **Big ask** - "Let me give you a 60-minute demo"
5. **Hype words** - "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "AI-powered"

## Template 1: The "Observation + Question" (Best Performer)

### The Message

**Subject:** [Specific observation about their company]

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] has 14 open engineering roles while also shipping [specific product/feature] this quarter.

Curious - how are you balancing shipping now vs. waiting for new hires to ramp?

Building tools in this space and trying to understand how leaders like you actually handle this.

Worth a 15-min chat?

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Subject line = observation | Not salesy, makes them curious |
| Specific numbers (14 roles) | Proves you researched, not mass blast |
| Names their product/feature | Shows you know what they're building |
| Question, not pitch | Engages their brain |
| "Leaders like you" | Mild flattery, positions them as expert |
| "15-min chat" | Low commitment ask |
| No company name/product pitch | Not about you |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Observation is wrong | Double-check LinkedIn jobs, press releases |
| They're not the right person | Add: "Or if there's someone better to talk to, happy to reach out to them" |
| Too busy to respond | Follow up in 5 days with new angle |

### Where to Find the Data

- **Open roles:** LinkedIn Jobs, company careers page
- **What they're shipping:** Company blog, changelog, press releases, Twitter
- **Team size:** LinkedIn company page, Crunchbase

## Template 2: The "Trigger Event" (Recently Funded)

### The Message

**Subject:** Congrats on the raise

```
Hi [Name],

Saw the Series [A/B] news - congrats. $[X]M to scale [what they do] is exciting.

The part that caught my attention: you're probably about to feel the pain of hiring 10+ engineers while trying to ship [their stated goal].

I've been talking to engineering leaders about this exact squeeze. Would love to hear how you're thinking about it.

15 min to swap notes?

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Congrats = positive opener | They're in a good mood about the raise |
| Specific dollar amount | Shows you read the actual announcement |
| "About to feel the pain" | Predicts their future, shows expertise |
| "Exact squeeze" | Names the problem concretely |
| "Swap notes" | Peer conversation, not sales pitch |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They just raised, not feeling pain yet | Acknowledge: "I know you're probably still celebrating - but curious how you're thinking ahead" |
| Lots of people congratulating them | Stand out by naming specific challenge, not just "congrats!" |
| Wrong timing (too early) | Wait 2-4 weeks post-announcement when reality sets in |

---

## Template 3: The "Content Response" (They Posted Something)

### The Message

**Subject:** Re: your post on [topic]

```
Hi [Name],

Your [LinkedIn post/tweet/blog] about [specific topic] nailed it - especially "[exact quote]".

I've been exploring a different angle on the same problem: what if specs could execute themselves instead of waiting in the backlog?

Would love to hear if that's crazy or if it resonates with what you've seen.

Worth a quick chat?

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Re:" subject | Looks like a reply, higher open rate |
| Exact quote | Undeniable proof you read it |
| "Nailed it" | Agreement builds rapport |
| "Different angle" | You're adding to the conversation, not selling |
| "Crazy or resonates" | Invites honest feedback, not validation |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Content is old | Only reference posts from last 30 days |
| Your angle seems irrelevant | Make the connection explicit: "This relates because..." |
| They post a lot, won't remember | Quote the exact line + date |

---

## Template 4: The "Specific Problem" (Direct Approach)

### The Message

**Subject:** Backlogs and bottlenecks

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question - at [Company]'s size (~[X] engineers), how do you handle the backlog growing faster than the team can ship?

I keep hearing three answers:
1. Hire faster (expensive, slow)
2. Cut scope (politics, hard trade-offs)
3. Find leverage (tools, process, AI)

Curious which camp you fall into.

Building in this space and trying to learn from people actually dealing with it.

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Subject = their pain | They open because it's relevant |
| Approximate team size | Shows research, acknowledges their scale |
| Three options | Makes it easy to respond (just pick one) |
| Each option has truth | Shows you understand the trade-offs |
| "Curious which camp" | Low-pressure, invites opinion |
| "Actually dealing with it" | Validates their experience is hard |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They don't relate to the problem | Wrong ICP - move on |
| Feels like a survey | Add personality: "Feel free to say 'none of the above' - I'm probably missing something" |
| No clear next step | Add: "Happy to share what others have said if you're curious" |

---

## Template 5: The "Mutual Problem" (Peer-to-Peer)

### The Message

**Subject:** Fellow [role] question

```
Hi [Name],

Fellow builder here - working on dev tools and trying to figure out if I'm solving a real problem.

You've scaled [Company] from [X] to [Y] engineers. I'm curious: at what point did the backlog start outpacing the team? And what actually helped?

Not selling anything - just trying to learn before I build the wrong thing.

Appreciate any perspective.

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Fellow builder" | Establishes peer relationship |
| "Real problem" | Shows intellectual honesty |
| Specific growth numbers | Proves research, validates their journey |
| "At what point" | Asks about their experience, not hypotheticals |
| "What actually helped" | Seeks real insight, not theory |
| "Build the wrong thing" | Vulnerability, they want to help |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Growth numbers are wrong | Use "roughly" or ranges |
| They didn't scale, they inherited | Adjust: "You've been leading [Company]'s engineering through [specific change]" |
| Feels too humble/uncertain | Balance with confidence: "I think I'm onto something but want to validate" |

## Template 6: The "Value-First" (Give Before Ask)

### The Message

**Subject:** [Specific resource] for [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Put together a quick breakdown of how 3 similar-sized teams ([Company A], [Company B], [Company C]) are handling the eng hiring bottleneck.

Happy to send it over if useful - no strings attached.

Also curious how [Company] is approaching it, if you're open to sharing.

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Subject promises value | Not about you, about them |
| "Quick breakdown" | Implies it won't waste their time |
| Names similar companies | Social proof + relevance |
| "No strings attached" | Removes suspicion |
| Ask comes second | You gave first |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They don't respond to ask for the resource | Send it anyway in follow-up: "Figured I'd send this regardless - hope it helps" |
| Resource isn't actually valuable | Make sure it's genuinely useful, not a disguised pitch |
| Feels like lead magnet bait | Keep it truly no-strings - don't gate it behind a call |

---

## Template 7: The "Breakup Email" (Final Follow-Up)

### The Message

**Subject:** Closing the loop

```
Hi [Name],

Reached out a couple times about how [Company] handles scaling engineering output. Sounds like timing isn't right - totally get it.

If you ever want to swap notes on this, I'm around.

Good luck with [specific thing they're working on].

Kevin
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Closing the loop" | Signals finality, creates urgency |
| Acknowledges previous outreach | Honest, not pretending |
| "Timing isn't right" | Gives them an excuse, saves face |
| "I'm around" | Leaves door open without pressure |
| Specific good luck | Shows you still know what they're doing |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They feel guilty | That's actually good - often triggers response |
| They were about to respond | Wait at least 10 days before sending |
| Comes across as passive-aggressive | Keep tone genuinely warm |

---

## Subject Line Formulas

| Formula | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Observation | "14 open roles + Q2 launch" | Specific = not spam |
| Question | "Quick question about [Company]'s roadmap" | Curiosity gap |
| Congrats | "Congrats on the Series B" | Positive, timely |
| Re: their content | "Re: your post on eng velocity" | Looks like reply |
| Mutual connection | "[Name] suggested I reach out" | Social proof |
| Pain point | "Backlogs and bottlenecks" | Relevance |
| Resource offer | "3 approaches to [problem]" | Value-first |

**Subject lines to AVOID:**
- "Quick question" (overused)
- "Introduction" (boring)
- "Partnership opportunity" (spam trigger)
- "Revolutionary AI tool" (hype = delete)
- "[Company name] + [Your company]" (obvious sales)

## Cadence: The Follow-Up Sequence

| Day | Action | Template |
|-----|--------|----------|
| 0 | Initial email | Choose from above |
| 3-5 | Bump | "Floating this up in case it got buried" |
| 7-10 | New angle | Different value prop or question |
| 14+ | Breakup | Template 7 |

**Rules:**
- Never follow up more than 3 times
- Each follow-up should add value, not just "checking in"
- If they say no, thank them and move on
- If they don't respond after breakup, wait 3 months before trying again

---

## Follow-Up Templates

### Follow-Up 1: The Bump (Day 3-5)

```
Hi [Name],

Floating this up - know these things get buried.

[One sentence reminder of original ask]

Either way, no worries.

Kevin
```

### Follow-Up 2: New Angle (Day 7-10)

```
Hi [Name],

Different angle - just talked to a VP Eng at [similar company] who said [interesting insight].

Made me curious if you're seeing the same thing at [Company].

Worth a quick chat?

Kevin
```
