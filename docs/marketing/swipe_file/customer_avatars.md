### Avatar: CTO Confession

```
cto confession:

i spend more time in meetings about the roadmap
than my team spends actually building the roadmap

something is wrong with this model
```

---

### Avatar: The Monday Dread

```
every monday:

- 23 tickets in backlog
- 4 engineers in meetings
- 2 PRs waiting for review since friday
- 1 critical bug from the weekend
- 0 clarity on what we'll actually ship

and they wonder why i look tired
```

### Avatar: The Hiring Loop

```
i've been interviewing for 3 months

finally hired someone great
3 weeks into onboarding
senior engineer gives notice

back to interviewing

this isn't scaling
this is a treadmill
```

---

### Avatar: The Review Pile

```
my morning routine:

7am: arrive before team
7:15: open PR queue
7:16: 14 PRs waiting
7:17: sigh
10am: reviewed 6 PRs
10:01: 4 new PRs arrived

the pile never shrinks
```

---

### Avatar: The Board Question

```
board meeting last week:

"why is the roadmap slipping?"

i wanted to say:
- because coordination costs 40% of engineering time
- because every feature needs 3 meetings
- because context switching is killing us
- because adding people makes it worse

i said: "we're working on process improvements"
```

---

### Avatar: The AI Skeptic

```
tried ai coding tools last quarter

the pitch: "10x productivity!"

the reality:
- agents got stuck constantly
- spent more time babysitting than coding
- code quality was inconsistent
- rolled back to manual work

i want to believe
but i've been burned
```

---

### Avatar: The Late Night

```
11pm. still at laptop.

reviewing PR #47 from cursor session
agent hallucinated a function again
tests passed because they were mocked
would have shipped a bug to production

my job is now "ai babysitter"

not what i signed up for
```

---

### Avatar: The Retro Reality

```
sprint retro this week:

what went well: "team worked hard"
what could improve: "literally everything"
action items: "will discuss in next retro"

we've been having the same retro for 6 months
```

---

### Avatar: The Coordination Tax

```
calculated our coordination overhead last week:

- standups: 10 hours/week
- planning: 8 hours/week
- reviews: 12 hours/week
- syncs: 6 hours/week

36 hours/week on coordination
for a 10-person team

that's almost a full headcount just talking about work
```

---

### Avatar: The Scaling Fear

```
we're about to hit 30 engineers

everyone says this is where teams break

- coordination explodes
- velocity drops
- politics emerge
- silos form

i'm supposed to scale the team
and i'm terrified of what happens next
```

---

### Avatar: What I Actually Want

```
what i tell the board: "we need faster development"

what i actually want:
- predictable delivery
- less firefighting
- weekends back
- confidence in estimates
- team that isn't burned out

shipping faster is a proxy for control
```

---

### Avatar: The AI Promise

```
every ai coding tool promises:

"you'll ship 10x faster!"

what i need:

- visibility into what's happening
- control over what ships
- reliability i can trust
- process that doesn't require babysitting

i don't need faster

i need better
```
