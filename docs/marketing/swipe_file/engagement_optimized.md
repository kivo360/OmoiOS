## Week 1 Posts

### EO1: The 4am Text

```
got a text from my senior engineer at 4am last week.

"hey sorry to wake you but the agent has been running for 6 hours and i think it's stuck but i'm not sure and i don't want to kill it if it's actually making progress"

that's the state of ai coding right now.

we pay senior engineers $200k+/year to watch progress bars and guess if they're broken.
```

---

### EO2: The Meeting Math

```
calculated how much our standup costs.

10 people x 15 min/day x 5 days x 52 weeks = 650 hours/year

at $90/hour average = $58,500/year

on one meeting.

we have 14 recurring meetings.

i'm scared to calculate the rest.
```

---

### EO3: Your Fault

```
hot take: if your product is actually good but has 0 traction...

it's YOUR fault.

not the market. not luck.

you suck at marketing/distribution.

building is now the bare minimum - anyone can do it with AI.
```

---

### EO4: Honest Question - Rewrite Rate

```
be honest:

what % of your AI-generated code do you actually ship without rewriting?

90%? 50%? 10%?

no judgment. genuinely curious.
```

---

### EO5: The $340 Night
<!-- BIP: true -->

```
woke up to a $340 API bill

one agent, one night, one rabbit hole

it kept calling the LLM asking "is this right?"
the LLM kept saying "try this instead"
loop continued for 8 hours

now we have budget limits per task

expensive lessons are the ones you remember
```

---

### EO6: The Intern Analogy

```
ai coding agents are like brilliant interns:

- enthusiastic
- fast
- technically capable
- zero judgment
- need constant supervision
- will confidently do the wrong thing

except the intern learns and stays
```

---

### EO7: The Real Numbers

```
did the math on our ai coding experiment.

3 months. 4 engineers using cursor daily.

actual results:
- individual coding: 1.4x faster
- pr review time: 2.3x longer
- bugs caught in staging: up 47%
- net velocity: roughly flat

we didn't get 10x. we got different.

nobody talks about this because it's not a good headline.
```

---

### EO8: Dumbest Thing Question

```
what's the dumbest thing an AI agent has confidently done in your codebase?

i'll start:

mine deleted a production config file because it "wasn't being used"

it was being used.
```

---

### EO9: Progress Bar Meme

```
ai agent progress:

10% - analyzing task
20% - planning approach
30% - implementing solution
40% - implementing solution
50% - implementing solution
60% - implementing solution
70% - why is it still implementing
80% - it's stuck
90% - it's definitely stuck
100% - never
```

---

### EO10: The Comparison That Hurts

```
my best engineer: $220k/year
my ai coding budget: $400/month

the $400/month tool requires my $220k/year engineer to babysit it.

"ai is replacing developers" lol

ai is making developers spend 30% of their time doing ai qa instead of building product.
```

---

### EO11: Engagement Bait - Frustrations

```
reply with your biggest AI coding frustration.

i'll explain how we solved the top 3 in our system.

examples:
- "agents get stuck for hours"
- "context loss mid-session"
- "drift from original task"

go
```

---

## Week 2 Posts

### EO12: CTO Conversation

```
call with a CTO last week:

him: "we need to ship faster"
me: "how many engineers?"
him: "47"
me: "how many in meetings right now?"
him: "...probably 30"
me: "that's your problem"

coordination tax is invisible until you count it
```

---

### EO13: Shadowbanned

```
are you really shadowbanned or do your tweets just suck?
```

---

### EO14: Vibe Coding Hot Take

```
hot take: "vibe coding" is just procrastination with extra steps

you're not shipping faster
you're deferring the hard decisions until they're 10x harder to fix

discipline isn't the enemy of speed
```

---

### EO15: Babysitter Short

```
my best engineer: $220k/year
my ai coding budget: $400/month

guess which one babysits the other
```

---

### EO16: 23% Success Rate

```
my ai coding tool has a 23% success rate on complex tasks.

tracked it myself:
- simple tasks (add button, fix typo): 89%
- medium tasks (new feature): 61%
- complex tasks (integration, architecture): 23%

77% of the time on hard problems, i'm cleaning up after the agent.

still faster than doing it myself? sometimes.

but definitely not autonomous.
```

---

### EO17: Rage Quit Question

```
cursor users:

how many times have you rage-quit a session this week?

0? 1-3? lost count?

trying to calibrate if i'm normal
```

---

### EO18: Small Refactor Disaster

```
agent started a "small refactor" yesterday.

14 files changed.
3 "temporary" workarounds.
tests disabled with TODO comments.
build broken for 2 hours.

the original task was adding a button.

i don't blame the agent.
i blame myself for not constraining it.
```

---

### EO19: Toddler Analogy

```
ai agents are like toddlers with superpowers:

- unlimited energy
- zero judgment
- will try anything
- need constant supervision
- confident in every decision
- leave a mess

except toddlers eventually grow up
```

---

### EO20: The Question That Haunts

```
genuine question i can't answer:

if ai coding makes individuals 1.5x faster
but creates 2x more review burden
and increases debugging time by 1.3x

are we actually ahead?

i've done the math three times.
got a different answer each time.
```

---

### EO21: Prompt Engineering Hot Take

```
unpopular opinion: "prompt engineering" is just admitting the tool is broken by default

"just write better prompts" means:
- the tool doesn't work out of the box
- you're compensating for bad architecture
- reproducibility is impossible

good systems shouldn't require magic words
```

---

### EO22: Thread - Why AI Agents Fail

```
why AI coding agents fail (a thread)

1/ they don't know when they're stuck
2/ they drift from the original task
3/ they forget context mid-session
4/ they hallucinate success
5/ they can't coordinate with each other

the solution isn't better models.
it's better architecture around the models.

/end
```

## Bonus High-Engagement Posts

### EO23: The Weekend Anxiety

```
saturday morning. laptop closed.
supposed to be off.

but i know there's an agent running on the migration task.

it's probably fine.

probably.

checked anyway.
it was stuck.
has been stuck for 6 hours.
burned through $180 in api calls doing nothing.

this is what "autonomous" actually feels like.

not freedom.
anxiety with extra steps.
```

---

### EO24: Demo vs Reality

```
ai coding demo:
"watch me build a todo app in 30 seconds!"

ai coding reality:
*4 hours later*
"why is it still building the todo app"
```

## Launch Story Posts (Jan 20th Launch)

### EO25: The Fear Was a Liar

```
launched 10 days ago.

for weeks i was convinced people would hate it.

"it's not ready"
"they'll tear it apart"
"who do you think you are"

hit publish. braced for impact.

first response? a stranger saying "congrats on the launch."

i broke down. actual tears.

all that fear. all that mental warfare.

and the first feedback was kindness.

the fear was a liar.

if you're holding back because you think people will hate you: you're probably wrong too.
```

---

### EO26: 10 Days Post-Launch

```
10 days since launch.

what i expected:
- mass criticism
- people pointing out every flaw
- imposter syndrome confirmed

what actually happened:
- strangers rooting for me
- useful feedback (not hate)
- people sharing their own stuck stories

the audience was kinder than the voice in my head.

ship it. find out.
```

---

### EO27: Launch Day Honesty

```
launch day confession:

i almost didn't hit publish.

had my finger on the button for 20 minutes.

"one more feature"
"fix that edge case"
"maybe next week"

shipped anyway.

10 days later: zero regrets.

the version that exists beats the perfect version that doesn't.
```

---

### EO28: The Real Launch Numbers

```
10 days post-launch. real numbers:

- mass hate received: 0
- useful feedback: 12 messages
- strangers who said congrats: 8
- people who tried it: 47
- bugs reported: 3 (all fixed)
- times i almost didn't launch: infinite

the fear was never about the product.

it was about me.
```

---

### EO29: What Launching Taught Me

```
what i learned from launching 10 days ago:

1. nobody cares as much as you think (liberating)
2. the critics in your head are louder than real ones
3. "not ready" is a feeling, not a fact
4. shipping is a skill separate from building
5. the first person to support you hits different

stop waiting. start learning.
```

---

## Additional High-Engagement Posts

### EO30: The Perfectionism Trap

```
perfectionism isn't high standards.

it's fear wearing a productivity costume.

"i'm just making it better" = "i'm scared to ship"

learned this the hard way.

shipped something imperfect 10 days ago.

still standing. actually thriving.
```

---

### EO31: Builder Question - Launch Fear

```
builders who've launched:

how long did you delay because of fear?

1 week? 1 month? 1 year?

trying to normalize that we all do this.

i delayed 3 weeks. shipped 10 days ago. wish i'd done it sooner.
```

---

### EO32: The Hate That Never Came

```
prepared for hate. got help.

prepared for criticism. got curiosity.

prepared for "who does he think he is." got "how does this work."

the internet is meaner in our imagination than in reality.

at least for builders shipping real things.
```

---

### EO33: Why Builders Don't Ship

```
why most builders don't ship:

10% - technical blockers
10% - time constraints
80% - fear of judgment

the code is ready.
the product works.
the finger hovers over publish.

and then... "maybe one more feature."

recognize this? yeah. me too.
```

---

### EO34: Ship It Question

```
what's stopping you from shipping right now?

not the excuse. the real reason.

for me it was fear of looking stupid.

shipped anyway. 10 days ago.

nobody called me stupid. a few people said thanks.

your turn. what's actually stopping you?
```

---

### EO35: The Voice In Your Head

```
the voice in your head before launching:

"they'll hate it"
"it's not good enough"
"you're not ready"
"wait until it's perfect"
"who are you to do this"

the voice after launching:

"...oh. that wasn't so bad."

ship it. silence the voice.
```
