# Competitor Callout Posts

Direct competitor comparisons. Use carefully - position as different category, not direct competition.

---

### Competitor: Cursor vs Platform

```
cursor helps you write code faster

but you still:
- plan the work
- coordinate the tasks
- babysit the agents
- fix stuck workflows

what if you just... didn't?
```

---

### Competitor: The Category Difference

```
cursor: ai pair programmer
antigravity: ai in your workflow
omoios: autonomous engineering execution

one helps you code
one helps you work
one works for you

different categories. different jobs.
```

---

### Competitor: The Self-Healing Gap

```
watched a cursor agent loop on the same error for 20 minutes yesterday

it didn't know it was stuck
i had to intervene

imagine if agents could detect drift and correct themselves

that's not fantasy—it's architecture
```

---

### Competitor: Antigravity Limitations

```
google antigravity shows you what agents did

artifacts are nice

but:
- agents still get stuck
- you still babysit execution
- no self-healing
- no spec-driven workflow

visibility isn't the same as reliability
```

---

### Competitor: Why Free is Expensive

```
antigravity is free

cursor is $20/month

omoios will charge based on value

free means:
- you're the product
- data trains their models
- no incentive to solve YOUR problems

free is expensive when it doesn't work
```

---

### Competitor: The 8 Agent Limit

```
cursor: run up to 8 agents in parallel

sounds impressive until:
- agents don't coordinate
- no cross-agent memory
- you manage conflicts manually
- stuck agents block everything

more agents isn't better
coordinated agents is better
```

---

### Competitor: Copilot Is Autocomplete

```
copilot: autocomplete on steroids
cursor: agents in your editor
antigravity: agents in google's ecosystem
omoios: agents that coordinate themselves

copilot isn't even in the same game

stop comparing apples to orchestras
```

---

### Competitor: The Babysitting Reality

```
reality check:

cursor agent: needs supervision
antigravity agent: needs supervision
copilot: needs you to type

all of them need YOU in the loop constantly

what if the loop was optional?
```

---

### Competitor: Different Buyer

```
cursor buyer: individual developer
antigravity buyer: individual developer
copilot buyer: individual developer

omoios buyer: engineering team

if you're one person, cursor is fine

if you're coordinating a team, you need something else
```

---

### Competitor: The Memory Gap

```
every time you start a new cursor chat:

- agent forgets your codebase patterns
- agent forgets the bug it fixed yesterday
- agent forgets your team's conventions

what if agents remembered?

what if they got smarter over time?
```

---

### Competitor: BugBot vs Spec Compliance

```
cursor has bugbot for code review

it checks:
- code quality
- potential bugs
- style issues

it doesn't check:
- "does this meet the requirement?"
- "is this what the spec asked for?"
- "does this integrate with the design?"

code quality ≠ correctness
```

---

### Competitor: Artifacts vs Phase Gates

```
antigravity artifacts: see what happened after

phase gates: approve what happens before

artifacts are a paper trail
phase gates are a control mechanism

one documents mistakes
one prevents them
```

---

### Competitor: The Speed Trap

```
cursor: 30-second turns with composer model

fast is good

but fast + wrong = expensive rework

what's faster:
- 30s to write wrong code + 2 hours to fix
- 5 minutes to spec correctly + 30 minutes to execute

speed without direction is just velocity
```

---

### Competitor: What They Don't Tell You

```
what cursor demos show:
- build a todo app in 60 seconds

what cursor demos hide:
- the 5 previous failed attempts
- the manual fixes between cuts
- the test file they deleted
- "it only works for simple apps"

marketing ≠ reality
```

---

### Competitor: The Enterprise Gap

```
cursor: built for individual devs
antigravity: built for individual devs

enterprise needs:
- team-level workflows
- approval chains
- budget controls
- audit trails
- compliance documentation

neither of them are enterprise-ready

they're developer tools, not team platforms
```
