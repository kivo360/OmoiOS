# General Builder/SaaS Posts

Universal builder wisdom that resonates regardless of your specific product. Good for daily engagement.

---

### Builder: The Quit Timing Problem

```
most builders quit their saas at 3-6 months in

right when:
- the messy infrastructure starts working
- growth curve actually begins

quitting right before it pays off
```

---

### Builder: Idea to Ship Gap

```
the gap between 'i have an idea' and 'i shipped something' is like 2 weeks max

but most stretch it to months with overthinking

just build the mvp—ideas die in your head
```

---

### Builder: Backend Reality

```
building a product:
90% backend plumbing nobody sees
10% ui everyone judges you on

focus on the invisible work first—it holds everything together
```

---

### Builder: Value Over Hype

```
founders chase 'viral' features for hype

instead:
- nail the core problem
- make it stupid simple

users come for value, not fireworks
```

---

### Builder: Consistency Wins

```
consistency > talent every time

post daily, ship weekly, iterate monthly

that's how you outlast the competition
```

---

### Builder: Feature Creep Kills

```
most saas fail from 'feature creep' not lack of ideas

start with 3 key features max

add only what users scream for
```

---

### Builder: Build in Public

```
building in public sounds scary

but:
- feedback loops tighten
- community builds itself

hide in shadows and nobody cares
```

---

### Builder: Momentum Hack

```
burnout hits when you grind without wins

hack: celebrate tiny ships—like fixing that one bug

momentum is everything
```

---

### Builder: Execution Test

```
ideas are worthless without execution

test: can you build a landing page in a day?

if not, simplify until you can
```

---

### Builder: Pricing Reality

```
saas pricing trap: undercharge to 'get users'

reality: charge what it's worth from day 1

weed out tire-kickers, attract serious ones
```

---

### Builder: The 2am Rule

```
if you're still excited about your product at 2am

you're onto something

if you're dreading it

pivot or quit—life's too short
```

---

### Builder: Feedback Paradox

```
early users want:
- more features
- faster delivery
- lower prices

what they need:
- fewer features that actually work
- slower delivery with quality
- fair prices that fund development

listen, but don't obey
```
