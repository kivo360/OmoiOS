## The Psychology of Warm Outreach

Warm outreach works because:
1. **Reciprocity** - People want to help people they know
2. **Low commitment** - You're asking for advice, not a sale
3. **Ego** - People like being asked for their expertise
4. **Curiosity** - If positioned right, they want to know what you're building

Warm outreach fails when:
1. **It feels transactional** - They sense you just want something
2. **It's too vague** - "Let's catch up" with no context
3. **It's too salesy** - You pitch before earning the right
4. **It's too long** - They don't have time to read a novel

## Template 1: The "Genuine Catch-Up" (Former Colleague)

### The Message

```
Hey [Name],

Been a while - hope [Company] is treating you well. Saw you're now [title/role], congrats on the move up.

I left [old company] and have been building something in the dev tools space. Trying to figure out if the problem I'm solving is real or just in my head.

You're one of the few people I know who's actually dealt with scaling engineering teams. Would love to pick your brain for 15-20 min - not selling anything, just want a reality check.

Free anytime this week or next?
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Been a while" | Acknowledges the gap, doesn't pretend it doesn't exist |
| Congrats on specific thing | Shows you actually looked them up, not mass blasting |
| "Building something" | Creates curiosity without pitching |
| "Real or just in my head" | Vulnerability, makes them want to help |
| "One of the few people" | Flattery that's earned (they have relevant experience) |
| "Not selling anything" | Removes pressure, lowers guard |
| "Reality check" | Positions them as the expert |
| Specific time ask | Makes it easy to say yes |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They're too busy | Keep it short, offer async option: "Or happy to send a few questions over email if easier" |
| You weren't that close | Add more personal context: "Remember when we [specific shared memory]?" |
| They've moved on from engineering | Adjust: "Even if you're not in the weeds anymore, your perspective would help" |

## Template 2: The "I Need Your Expertise" (Industry Contact)

### The Message

```
Hi [Name],

Random question for you - you're the first person I thought of.

I'm building a tool that helps engineering teams ship faster without hiring more. Before I go too far down this road, I'm trying to understand: is this actually a problem worth solving?

Given your experience at [Company] scaling from [X] to [Y] engineers, I'd love to hear:
- Did you ever feel like the backlog grew faster than headcount?
- What did you try that worked/didn't work?

15 min call or even a few bullets over email would be huge.

No pitch, I promise - just trying to learn before I build the wrong thing.
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Random question" | Casual, not formal/corporate |
| "First person I thought of" | Makes them feel uniquely qualified |
| One sentence on what you're building | Just enough to give context |
| "Before I go too far" | Implies you value their input enough to course-correct |
| Specific questions | Shows you're prepared, respects their time |
| "15 min or a few bullets" | Gives them an easy out if busy |
| "Build the wrong thing" | Vulnerability, they want to save you from failure |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Questions feel like homework | Make them multiple choice: "Was it more A or B?" |
| They don't remember you well | Add context: "We met at [event] / worked together on [project]" |
| They're skeptical of "no pitch" | Be genuinely ready to NOT pitch. If they ask, say "I'll tell you about it after I hear your thoughts" |

## Template 3: The "Mutual Connection Intro Request"

### To Your Mutual Connection

```
Hey [Mutual Friend],

Quick favor - I see you're connected to [Target Name] at [Company].

I'm working on something for engineering teams and they seem like exactly the kind of person who'd have good insight. Not trying to sell them anything - just want 15 min to understand how teams like theirs handle [specific problem].

Would you be comfortable making an intro? Totally fine if not - I know intros can be awkward.

If yes, here's a short blurb you can forward:

---

"Hey [Target], my friend Kevin is building dev tools and is trying to learn from engineering leaders before he builds the wrong thing. He's not selling - just doing customer research. Worth 15 min if you have it. I'll let him explain more."

---

Thanks either way!
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Quick favor" | Sets expectations it's small |
| "Not trying to sell" | Removes pressure from mutual friend |
| "Totally fine if not" | Gives them an easy out, paradoxically makes them more likely to help |
| Pre-written blurb | Removes friction, they just forward |
| Blurb is short and casual | Doesn't make mutual friend look like they're pushing a sales pitch |
| "I'll let him explain more" | Defers to you, doesn't put words in your mouth |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Mutual friend doesn't want to spend social capital | Make it clear there's no downside: "If [Target] says no, I won't follow up again" |
| The blurb feels too templated | Personalize: "He mentioned he loved that blog post you wrote about X" |
| Target ignores the intro | Follow up once with mutual friend: "Hey, did [Target] ever respond? No worries if not" |

## Template 4: The "Saw Your Content" (LinkedIn/Twitter Connection)

### The Message

```
Hey [Name],

Your post about [specific topic] hit home - especially the part about [specific quote or point].

I've been obsessing over the same problem from a different angle. Building tools to help engineering teams ship without the hire-and-wait cycle.

Would love to hear how you've seen this play out at [Company]. 15 min to swap notes?

Not a pitch - genuinely trying to learn from people in the trenches.
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Reference specific content | Proves you're not mass blasting |
| "Hit home" | Emotional connection, you relate to them |
| Quote their exact words | Shows you actually read it |
| "Obsessing over the same problem" | You're peers exploring together, not seller/buyer |
| "Different angle" | Creates curiosity |
| "Swap notes" | Implies you have value to offer too |
| "In the trenches" | Validates their experience is hard-won |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They post a lot, won't remember the specific post | Be very specific: "Your post from [date] about [exact topic]" |
| Feels like flattery fishing | Add substance: "I disagreed with [one point] though - curious your take on [alternative]" |
| They get a lot of these | Make your angle unique: "Most people build X, I'm trying Y" |

## Template 5: The "Honest Struggle" (Close Contact)

### The Message

```
Hey [Name],

Gonna be real with you - I'm stuck.

I've been building this tool for engineering teams, and I think it solves a real problem, but I'm having trouble articulating who exactly needs it and why.

You've always been good at cutting through BS. Can I get 20 min to explain what I'm building and have you poke holes in it?

I need someone to tell me what's wrong with my thinking, not just nod along.
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Gonna be real" | Signals authenticity, not a polished pitch |
| "I'm stuck" | Vulnerability, triggers helper instinct |
| "Good at cutting through BS" | Specific compliment that gives them permission to be critical |
| "Poke holes" | You're inviting criticism, which is rare and refreshing |
| "Not just nod along" | Shows you're serious, not looking for validation |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| They don't feel qualified | Reassure: "You don't need to be an expert - I just need a smart outsider perspective" |
| They're worried about hurting your feelings | Give permission: "Seriously, the more critical the better. I'd rather hear it now than after I waste 6 months" |
| Too heavy/emotional for a casual relationship | Lighten it: "No pressure if you're slammed - just thought I'd ask before I spiral further lol" |

## Template 6: The "Quick Async Ask" (Very Busy Contact)

### The Message

```
Hey [Name],

Know you're slammed, so I'll keep this async.

Building something for engineering teams. One question I can't figure out:

**When your backlog grows faster than your team can ship, what's the first thing you try?**

A) Hire faster
B) Cut scope
C) Find productivity tools
D) Accept the backlog and prioritize ruthlessly
E) Something else: ___

Just hit reply with a letter - would help me a ton.
```

### Why It Works

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Know you're slammed" | Acknowledges their reality |
| "Keep this async" | Signals low commitment |
| One specific question | Easy to answer |
| Multiple choice | Even easier to answer |
| "Just hit reply with a letter" | Lowest possible friction |
| "Would help me a ton" | Small effort, big impact for you |

### Why It Might Fail

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Feels like a survey | Add: "And feel free to rant if you want - I'll read every word" |
| They want more context | Add: "Happy to explain more if you're curious what I'm building" |
| They answer but you can't follow up | Include: "If you're open to a quick follow-up question, let me know" |

## Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Do

### Bad Example 1: The Vague Ask

```
Hey! Long time no talk. Would love to catch up sometime. Let me know if you're free!
```

**Why it fails:**
- No context on what you want
- No reason for them to prioritize
- "Sometime" is never

### Bad Example 2: The Premature Pitch

```
Hey [Name]! I built this amazing tool that uses AI agents to write code from specs. It's going to revolutionize how engineering teams work. I'd love to show you a demo - when are you free?
```

**Why it fails:**
- All about you, nothing about them
- "Amazing" and "revolutionize" = hype, not substance
- Asking for demo before establishing interest
- No value offered to them

### Bad Example 3: The Guilt Trip

```
Hey, I've reached out a few times but haven't heard back. I know you're busy but this would really mean a lot to me. Just 15 minutes?
```

**Why it fails:**
- Makes them feel bad (they'll avoid you)
- Needy energy repels
- Guilt doesn't build relationships

### Bad Example 4: The Novel

```
Hey [Name],

Hope this email finds you well! I wanted to reach out because I've been thinking a lot about the future of software development and how AI is changing everything. You know, back when we worked together at [Company], I always admired how you approached problems...

[4 more paragraphs]

...anyway, would love to chat if you have time!
```

**Why it fails:**
- Too long, won't be read
- Buried ask at the end
- Rambling shows you don't respect their time

## Follow-Up Templates

### If No Response After 5 Days

```
Hey [Name] - floating this back up in case it got buried. No worries if you're swamped.
```

### If No Response After 10 Days (Final)

```
Hey [Name] - closing the loop on this. Sounds like timing isn't right, totally get it.

If you ever want to swap notes on [topic], I'm around. Good luck with [something specific to them].
```

**Why the final message works:**
- Graceful exit
- Leaves door open
- Shows you're not desperate
- They often reply to this one because the pressure is off
