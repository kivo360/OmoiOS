## Part 3: The Aha Moment Discovery Plan

### Hypothesis: Possible Aha Moments

| Moment | What They'd Say |
|--------|-----------------|
| Spec → Working Code | "Wait, it actually built that from my spec?" |
| Codebase Understanding | "It matched our coding conventions..." |
| Parallel Execution | "3 features in progress at once?" |
| Context Retention | "It remembered the requirements from yesterday" |
| Junior Leverage | "My junior shipped that in 2 hours?!" |

### How to Find the Real Aha Moment

**Week 1-2: Get 5 Users**
1. Reach out to 3 friendly developers you know
2. Offer free access in exchange for 30-min screen share
3. Give them a real task from THEIR backlog
4. Watch silently, note when their expression changes
5. Ask: "What surprised you most?"

**Week 3-4: Validate**
1. Look for patterns across all 5 sessions
2. The repeated surprise = your aha moment
3. Build onboarding to get users there FAST

### Aha Moment Tracking Template

```markdown
## User Session: [Name] - [Date]

**Background:** [Role, company size, tech stack]

**Task Given:** [What you asked them to do]

**Timeline:**
- 0:00 - Started...
- 5:23 - First reaction: "..."
- 12:45 - Second reaction: "..."

**Aha Moment:** [Exact quote, exact timestamp]

**What triggered it:** [What they saw/experienced]

**Follow-up quote:** [What they said after]
```

## Part 4: Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Recently Funded Company

```
Subject: Congrats on the Series [A/B] - quick question

Hi [Name],

Saw the news about [Company]'s raise - congrats. [Specific detail about what you're building that's interesting].

With the growth ahead, I'm curious: how are you thinking about scaling engineering output without 6 months of hiring/onboarding lag?

Building something in this space and would value 15 mins of your perspective. No pitch, just learning.

Either way, excited to watch [Company] grow.

Kevin
```

### Template 2: Slack Community Warm Outreach

```
Hey [Name],

Loved your comment in #[channel] about [specific thing they said].

I've been thinking about the same problem from a different angle - [one sentence about OmoiOS without naming it].

Would you be open to a 15-min call to swap notes? Trying to validate some assumptions.

No pitch - genuinely just want to learn from people dealing with this.
```

### Template 3: LinkedIn Connection Request

```
Hi [Name] - been following your posts on [topic].

Building tools for engineering teams scaling past 20 engineers. Would love to hear how [Company] is handling the backlog vs. headcount challenge.

Happy to share what I'm learning from other EMs too.
```
