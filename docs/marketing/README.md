## The Strategy in One Page

### 1. Pick ONE Niche
Don't be generic. Choose one specific sub-niche from either:
- **Software-focused**: See [Sub-Niche Targeting](./sub_niche_targeting.md)
  - Recommended: Communication Integrations (Slack/Teams/Discord) or Audit Logging & Compliance
- **Cross-market**: See [Cross-Market Niche Ideas](./cross_market_niche_ideas.md)
  - 15 industries from real estate to insurance to agriculture

### 2. Validate with Reality
Use the [Reality Outreach Playbook](./reality_contact_outreach_playbook.md):
- 2-week sprint
- 60-120 touches
- Goal: 1-3 merged PRs + 1 repeat customer

### 3. Prove Before Expanding
- 3-5 merged PRs in target niche
- 1 paying pilot or repeat customer
- Clear "this works" pattern
- THEN consider second niche

### 4. Expand Methodically
Per [Go-to-Market Strategy](./go_to_market_strategy.md):
- Phase 0: Message + proof (2-4 weeks)
- Phase 1: Private beta (4-8 weeks)
- Phase 2: Public beta (8-12 weeks)
- Phase 3: Sales assist

## Key Decisions Still Pending

- [ ] **Which niche to start with** (software vs cross-market)
- [ ] **Pricing model** (per agent, per workspace, open-core)
- [ ] **Open source timing** (closed during validation vs OSS for trust/distribution)
