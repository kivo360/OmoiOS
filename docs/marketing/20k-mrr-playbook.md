# How to Reach €20K MRR for Your SaaS

> Source: Romàn Czerny (Gojiberry AI) - scaled to €500K ARR with Coco AI, sold it, now doing it again.

## The Formula

**€10K MRR = 100 customers × €100/month**

This is where the magic starts. It proves your product is scalable and there's real demand.

---

## 1. Validate Fast, Pivot Faster

- Define your problem and target audience
- Build a quick landing page or prototype
- Talk to real users and test willingness to pay
- Pivot if needed before writing a single line of code

**The classic mistake**: Building a SaaS without talking to people. If people are ready to give you their credit card before you've written code, you're on the right track.

**Action Plan:**
1. List your ideas
2. Create a very simple landing page
3. Find potential customers to talk to
4. If they're ready to pay by end of call, you're on the right track

---

## 2. Build a Product That Solves One Pain Well

### Finding a Co-founder
- **Solo marketer**: Partner with a CTO (worth 10 developers, but you'll own 50%)
- **Solo developer**: Team up with a marketer to grow faster
- **Avoid dev agencies**: Bug on Saturday, reply on Monday = painful

**Where to find co-founders**: Post in startup and incubator groups. Don't sign anything before first euros come in.

### Feature Philosophy
> "One feature should be enough at the beginning. Do one thing, but do it better than anyone else."

Never build a feature unless you're 100% sure it will:
- Increase retention
- Improve customer results
- Grow revenue

Everything else is a waste of time.

**Process**: Build one feature → Sell it → See results → Iterate

---

## 3. Find Your Pricing Sweet Spot

**Start by matching competitors** - if they're winning at that price, your offer can too.

### Testing Process (Gojiberry example)
- Started with demos only, no pricing shown
- Tested: €499 → €297 → €199 → €99
- At €497: Sales happened, but high churn
- At €297: More sales, but required manual demos
- At €99: Self-serve, best retention

**Result**: €99/month with 7-day free trial

---

## 4. Get Your First 10 Paying Customers

**No magic formula - you have to grind.**

Your first 10 can come from:
- Friends making introductions
- Picking up phone and calling until 10 say yes
- Manual LinkedIn DMs
- Cold emails

**Goal**: Get 20-30 meetings → Close 10

### The Simple Process
1. LinkedIn outreach from personal account
2. Send messages until someone replies
3. Offer a demo
4. Use a simple slide deck to convert

**Don't accept**: "I'm interested, but maybe later"
**Do get**: "Okay, let's do it"

### The Slide Deck
Keep it VERY basic. 5-7 slides made in 15 minutes:
- Problem statement
- Your solution
- How it works
- Results/proof
- Pricing
- Next steps

---

## 5. Handle Support and Customer Success

### Basics
- Add chat bubble (Crisp or alternatives)
- Schedule check-in calls on Day 7 and Day 15

### Questions to Ask
- What parts of the product are you using?
- What do you like or dislike?
- Would you leave a review?
- Would you recommend us to someone else?

**Key insight**: Much harder to acquire new customer than keep existing one. Spot churn signs early - by the time someone decides to leave, it's too late.

**Sequence**:
- Day 1: Value + context
- Day 3: Soft reminder
- Day 7: Proof/case study
- Day 10: Break-up

**Follow-up (Day 3)**:
```
Hey {{firstName}}, just checking if this landed on your radar. I only reached out because of {{signal}} and thought it could be useful. Worth a quick look?
```

**Break-up (Day 7-10)**:
```
No worries if not a priority right now, I'll close this loop. If it ever becomes relevant, feel free to ping me.
```
