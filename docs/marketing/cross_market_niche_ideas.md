> **Status**: Starter ideas for exploration
> **Goal**: Identify low-risk niches at the intersection of software + other markets

## The Insight

OmoiOS automates spec-driven software execution. But "software" touches every industry. The lowest-risk opportunities may be where:

1. **Software is a means, not the end** (they need software but aren't software companies)
2. **Specs are already well-defined** (industry standards, regulations, templates)
3. **Current solutions are expensive** (agencies, consultants, custom dev shops)
4. **Failure is recoverable** (not life-critical, not financial-critical)

---

## Cross-Market Niches to Explore

> **Note**: These complement the software-focused niches in [Sub-Niche Targeting](./sub_niche_targeting.md). Start with one from either list, not both simultaneously.

| **Listing Syndication Tools** | "Updating listings across Zillow/Redfin/MLS is manual hell" | Automated listing sync with custom branding |
| **Maintenance Request Systems** | "We're still using paper forms and phone calls" | Simple ticket → contractor assignment → completion tracking |
