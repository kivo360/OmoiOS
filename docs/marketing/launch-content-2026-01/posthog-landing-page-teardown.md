## The Hook

You're getting traffic to your site.

You think people are interested.

Then you watch the PostHog sessions.

## The Brutal Reality

I spent this week watching 47 session recordings of people visiting my landing page.

Here's what the numbers said:

- **Average session duration**: 8 seconds
- **Scroll depth**: 23%
- **CTA clicks**: 2.1%
- **Bounce rate**: 84%

They land. They scan. They leave.

## What I Thought vs. What I Saw

**What I thought was happening:**
- People reading my value prop
- Scanning features
- Deciding it's not for them

**What's actually happening:**
- People read the headline
- Get confused
- Leave before scrolling

The problem isn't that they're not interested.

The problem is I'm not giving them a reason to stay in the first 3 seconds.

## Problem #1: The Headline Says Nothing

My current headline:

> "AI-Powered Development Orchestration"

What I think it says: sophisticated, technical, valuable.

What visitors think: another AI buzzword salad.

`[INSERT SCREENSHOT: Scroll heatmap dying at the fold]`

**The evidence:**

In session after session, I watched the same pattern:
1. Eyes hit headline
2. Slight pause (confusion)
3. Mouse moves to close tab

Nobody scrolls past something they don't understand.

---

## Problem #2: No Immediate Value Proposition

My page structure:
1. Pretty gradient hero
2. Feature list
3. Pricing
4. Footer

What's missing: **Why should anyone care?**

I never answer the only question that matters in the first 5 seconds:

> "What do you DO and why should I give you 30 more seconds?"

## Problem #3: Features ≠ Benefits

My current page lists:
- Agent orchestration
- Spec-driven workflows
- Real-time monitoring
- Phase gates

What CTOs actually want to know:
- Will my team ship faster?
- Will I spend less time babysitting?
- Will output be more predictable?
- What's the ROI?

**Features are what I built.**

**Benefits are what they get.**

I was talking about myself, not about them.

---

## The Pattern I Saw Across 47 Sessions

| Behavior | Count | % |
|----------|-------|---|
| Left within 5 seconds | 31 | 66% |
| Scrolled below fold | 16 | 34% |
| Clicked any link | 4 | 8.5% |
| Clicked CTA | 1 | 2.1% |

The funnel isn't leaking. It's a sieve.

## What I'm Changing

### Before → After: The Headline

❌ **Before**: "AI-Powered Development Orchestration"

✅ **After**: "Your devs ship 2x more without working 2x harder"

The new headline:
- States a benefit (2x output)
- Addresses the fear (not more hours)
- Speaks to the buyer (you, your devs)

### Before → After: The Hero Section

❌ **Before**:
- Gradient background
- Vague tagline
- "Get Started" button

✅ **After**:
- Problem statement they recognize
- Solution in plain English
- Proof it works (screenshot or number)
- Social proof above the fold

### Before → After: The Structure

❌ **Before**: Hero → Features → Pricing

✅ **After**: Problem → Solution → Proof → Features → CTA

---

## The 5-Second Test

Above the fold, in 5 seconds, visitors need to see:

1. **Problem they recognize**
   "Your devs spend 30% of their time babysitting AI tools"

2. **Solution in plain English**
   "Agents that actually work autonomously"

3. **Proof it works**
   Screenshot, number, or testimonial

That's it. Everything else is secondary.

---

## The Lesson

**LOOK AT YOUR POSTHOG SESSIONS.**

Not your analytics dashboard.
Not your traffic numbers.
Not your conversion rate.

Watch actual humans interact with your site.

It's uncomfortable.
It's humbling.
It's the fastest way to stop lying to yourself.

---

## What's Next

I'm shipping the new landing page this week.

I'll post the before/after with real session data:
- Same traffic source
- Same time period
- Different page

If the numbers improve, I'll share exactly what worked.

If they don't, I'll share that too.

That's what building in public means.

---

## Your Turn

When's the last time you watched someone use your site?

Not looked at analytics. Actually watched.

If it's been more than a month, you're flying blind.

The data is there. The sessions are recorded.

The only question is whether you're willing to look.

---

## TL;DR

1. Pretty landing pages can still fail
2. Session recordings reveal truth analytics hide
3. You have ~3 seconds to answer "why should I care?"
4. Features ≠ Benefits
5. Watch your PostHog sessions. Today.
