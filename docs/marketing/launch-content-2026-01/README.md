## Two Types of Content

### 1. The Mental Game Content Series — BUILDING IN PUBLIC
**File:** `The-Mental-Game-Content-Series.docx`

**Purpose:** Building in public content. The emotional, human side of launching a startup. This is for connecting with founders, indie hackers, and anyone who's been through the mental warfare of shipping something.

An 8-post content series about the emotional reality of building a startup. Each post has two versions:
- **Raw version** — for X (Twitter) and Reddit. Unfiltered, includes profanity, stream of consciousness.
- **Polished version** — for LinkedIn and Indie Hackers. Same message, professional tone.

**Posts:**
1. The Voice That Says You're Not Ready (imposter syndrome)
2. People Are Going to Hate Me (fear of judgment)
3. The War Inside Your Head (mental warfare + technical perfectionism)
4. The Shit Nobody Posts About (bugs, errors, delayed launches)
5. The Fear of Taking People's Money (charging for your work)
6. You Might Not Make It (realistic odds)
7. Positive Thinking as Survival (mindset as a tool)
8. I Was Wrong About the Hate (launch day emotions — THE HOOK)

**Post Order:** Start with Post 8 (the payoff), then tell the backstory with Posts 1-7.

### 2. Hacker News Show HN Post — TECHNICAL POSITIONING
**File:** `HackerNews-ShowHN-Post.md`

**Purpose:** Technical content for developers and engineers. This is where we explain the architecture, compare to existing tools, and establish technical credibility. HN is the place where people will ask hard questions — this doc has the answers.

**Why this matters:** The Mental Game series builds emotional connection. The HN post builds technical respect. You need both.

**What's in here:**
- **Tool comparisons** — How OmoiOS stacks up against Cursor, Claude Code, and Ralph/Ralphy
- **Architecture explanation** — DAG-based orchestration, spec validation, the Guardian loop
- **Prepared Q&A** — Pre-written responses for the questions HN will definitely ask
- **Positioning** — OmoiOS = Ralph + specs + parallelization + a guardian that catches semantic drift

Technical comparisons include:
- **Cursor** — AI-first IDE, human drives
- **Claude Code** — Agentic CLI, goal-driven
- **Ralph/Ralphy** — Autonomous loop technique (`while true; do claude; done`)
- **OmoiOS** — Spec-driven DAG orchestration with continuous validation

Includes:
- Multiple title options
- Two post body versions (accessible vs. deep technical)
- Pre-written comment replies for expected questions
- Posting strategy tips
