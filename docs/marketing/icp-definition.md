## The Pain (Why They Buy)

### Trigger Events
These moments create urgency:

1. **Just missed a deadline** - Client/stakeholder trust damaged
2. **Lost a deal to a faster competitor** - "They shipped it in 3 weeks, we quoted 3 months"
3. **Key engineer quit** - Took 6 months of context with them
4. **Board pressure** - "Why is velocity dropping as we hire more?"
5. **Hiring freeze** - Backlog keeps growing, headcount doesn't

### The Quantifiable Problem

| Pain Point | Cost |
|------------|------|
| Senior engineer salary | $150-250K/year |
| Time to hire | 3-6 months |
| Onboarding to productivity | 3-6 months |
| Context switching overhead | 20-40% productivity loss |
| Missed deadline penalties | $10K-100K+ per incident |
| Technical debt accumulation | 2-3x future development cost |

### Emotional State
- Frustrated: "We keep hiring but don't ship faster"
- Anxious: "One resignation away from missing our roadmap"
- Skeptical: "AI coding tools make junior-level mistakes"
- Desperate: "I'll try anything at this point"

---

## The Promise (What We Offer)

### Before OmoiOS
- Backlog grows faster than team can ship
- Senior engineers stuck on routine tasks
- Context lost when people leave
- Hiring is the only way to scale

### After OmoiOS
- Specs turn into working code autonomously
- Senior engineers focus on architecture & review
- Institutional knowledge captured in specs
- Scale output without scaling headcount

### The Offer (Draft)
> "Ship 2-3x more features without hiring another engineer. We'll prove it on your actual backlog in 2 weeks or you pay nothing."

### Cold Outreach Signals

Look for companies showing these signals:

1. **Hiring aggressively** - 10+ engineering roles open on LinkedIn
2. **Just raised funding** - Series A/B announcements (Crunchbase alerts)
3. **Scaling pains visible** - Glassdoor reviews mentioning "too much work", "burnout"
4. **Tech stack match** - Using technologies OmoiOS supports well
5. **Public roadmap delays** - Changelog shows slipped dates

---

## Cold Email Strategy

### Research Before Outreach
1. Find their tech blog / engineering blog
2. Check their GitHub org activity
3. Look at their job postings (what skills = what problems)
4. Find interviews/podcasts with their engineering leaders

### Email Framework (Ogilvy-style: short, clear, natural)

**Subject:** [Specific observation about their company]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

[One sentence showing you researched them - specific to their situation]

[One sentence about the pain you solve - framed as a question]

[One sentence offer - specific, low-commitment]

[Clear CTA - one action]

[Signature]
```

**Example:**
```
Hi Sarah,

Saw you're hiring 12 engineers while also shipping a new payments integration by Q2.

What if you could ship that integration without waiting for the new hires to ramp up?

I built a tool that turns specs into working code - happy to show you on a real ticket from your backlog. 15 min, no pitch.

Worth a look?

Kevin
```

### Follow-up Cadence
- Day 0: Initial email
- Day 3: Bump ("Floating this up")
- Day 7: New angle/value add
- Day 14: Breakup email ("Closing the loop")
