## Abstract

<!-- 2-3 sentences. A reader should understand the proposal's purpose in 30 seconds. -->

## Motivation

<!-- Why is this change needed? Include data, user research, or metrics where possible. -->

## Specification

<!-- Concrete technical details. Reference real codebase files (relative paths from repo root).
     Include: new routes, components, API endpoints, database changes, configuration.
     Be specific enough that another engineer could implement this without further clarification. -->

## Rationale

<!-- Why this approach over alternatives? What trade-offs were considered?
     Discuss rejected alternatives and why they were not chosen. -->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!-- How does this affect existing users and behavior?
     If not applicable, state "No backwards compatibility concerns." -->

## Security Considerations

<!-- Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, abuse vectors, data exposure.
     Every proposal must address security, even if the answer is "no new attack surface." -->

## Impact Assessment

<!-- Estimated effort, infrastructure costs, and expected user impact.
     Include metrics for measuring success. -->

## Open Issues

<!-- Unresolved questions for discussion. Remove this section when all issues are resolved. -->
