# Figma Make Prompt 6: Graph, Phases & Statistics

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED**: This file has been split into two separate prompts for better organization:
> - **[prompt_6a_graph_phases.md](./prompt_6a_graph_phases.md)** - Graph & Phase Management Pages (7 pages)
> - **[prompt_6b_statistics_activity.md](./prompt_6b_statistics_activity.md)** - Statistics & Activity Pages (2 pages)
>
> Please use the split prompts instead of this file.

The original prompt was too long and has been divided to stay within the ~4,000 character target for Figma Make.
