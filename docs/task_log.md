- **Task Objective**: Implement Stream E Phase Definitions & State Machine (Phase enums, history model, service logic, API, migration) following TDD.
- **Step-by-Step Plan**:
  1. Analyze existing ticket/task models and database setup to understand integration points.
  2. Write failing tests for phases enum/sequence/transitions, then implement `omoi_os/models/phases.py`.
  3. Write failing tests for `PhaseHistory` model and phase tracking on tickets; implement models and migration pieces incrementally.
  4. Implement `PhaseService` with tests covering transitions, history recording, and helpers.
  5. Extend API routes and ensure phase endpoints are tested end-to-end.
  6. Create Alembic migration to add `phase_history` table and new ticket columns, then run full test + lint suite.
- **Results**: In progress — planning and requirement review complete.
