# Understanding Spec-Driven Development

At the heart of OmoiOS is spec-driven development - a methodology that transforms natural language descriptions into working software through a structured workflow.

## What is a Spec?

A spec in OmoiOS is a high-level description of what you want to build. Unlike traditional requirements documents, specs are:

- **Conversational** - Written in natural language
- **Outcome-focused** - Describe what, not how
- **Iterative** - Can be refined through feedback

### Example Spec

Here's a simple spec for a notification system:

```
Add a notification system that:
- Sends email notifications for important events
- Shows in-app notifications with a badge counter
- Allows users to configure notification preferences
- Supports digest mode (daily summary vs. real-time)
```

## The Spec Lifecycle

Every spec in OmoiOS goes through a defined lifecycle:

### 1. Explore Phase

When you create a spec, OmoiOS first explores your codebase to understand:

- Existing patterns and conventions
- Related code and dependencies
- Potential integration points
- Technical constraints

This exploration happens automatically through specialized explorer agents.

### 2. Requirements Phase

Based on the exploration, OmoiOS generates detailed requirements:

- Functional requirements (what the feature does)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security)
- Edge cases and error handling
- Integration requirements

You review these requirements and provide feedback before proceeding.

### 3. Design Phase

With approved requirements, OmoiOS creates a technical design:

- Architecture decisions
- Data models and schemas
- API contracts
- Component structure

The design phase ensures everyone (including agents) understands the approach.

### 4. Tasks Phase

The design is broken down into atomic, parallelizable tasks:

- Each task has clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies between tasks are identified
- Tasks are sized for efficient agent execution

### 5. Execution Phase

Finally, developer agents pick up tasks and implement them:

- Code is written following your project's conventions
- Tests are generated alongside implementation
- Code reviews happen automatically

## Best Practices for Writing Specs

### Be Specific About Outcomes

**Good:**
```
Allow users to export their data in CSV and JSON formats,
including all projects, tasks, and comments.
```

**Less Good:**
```
Add export functionality.
```

### Include Constraints

If you have specific requirements, state them:

```
Build a search feature that:
- Returns results in under 200ms
- Supports fuzzy matching
- Works without requiring a reindex
```

### Reference Existing Patterns

OmoiOS understands your codebase, so you can reference existing code:

```
Add pagination to the task list, similar to how
we handle pagination in the project list.
```
