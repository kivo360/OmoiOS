# Welcome to OmoiOS

We're excited to introduce OmoiOS, a revolutionary platform that transforms how software development teams work. By combining spec-driven development with multi-agent orchestration, we enable teams to scale their output without scaling their headcount.

## What is OmoiOS?

OmoiOS is a complete development orchestration platform built around a simple but powerful idea: **autonomous agents can handle the execution while humans focus on direction and quality**.

### The Problem We Solve

Modern software teams face a common challenge:
- Requirements are often unclear or incomplete
- Development workflows are fragmented across tools
- Scaling means hiring, which means management overhead
- Context switching kills productivity

### Our Approach

OmoiOS introduces a structured workflow that guides projects from idea to implementation:

1. **Explore** - Agents research the codebase and understand context
2. **Requirements** - Generate detailed, actionable requirements
3. **Design** - Create technical designs with architecture decisions
4. **Tasks** - Break down work into manageable, parallelizable tasks
5. **Execute** - Deploy agents to implement the solution

## Key Features

### Spec-Driven Development

Everything in OmoiOS starts with a spec. Specs are natural language descriptions of what you want to build:

```
Build a user authentication system with:
- Email/password login
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Rate limiting
```

From this simple description, OmoiOS generates requirements, designs, and tasks that agents can execute.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

OmoiOS doesn't rely on a single AI model. Instead, it orchestrates multiple specialized agents:

- **Explorer agents** for codebase research
- **Planner agents** for requirements and design
- **Developer agents** for code implementation
- **Reviewer agents** for quality assurance

### Phase Gates

Every major transition includes a phase gate - a checkpoint where you can review, provide feedback, and approve before moving forward. This keeps humans in control while letting agents handle the heavy lifting.

## Getting Started

Ready to try OmoiOS? Check out our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) to create your first project in minutes.

## What's Next

We're just getting started. In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing:

- Deep dives into our agent architecture
- Best practices for writing effective specs
- Case studies from early adopters
- Tips for maximizing agent productivity

Stay tuned, and welcome to the future of software development.
