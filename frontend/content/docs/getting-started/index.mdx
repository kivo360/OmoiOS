# Getting Started

Welcome to OmoiOS! This guide will help you get started with the platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 22+** installed
- **Python 3.11+** installed

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash

### 2. Install Dependencies

OmoiOS uses `uv` for Python and `pnpm` for JavaScript:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
just install
```

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
```
