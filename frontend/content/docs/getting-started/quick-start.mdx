# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through creating your first OmoiOS project and deploying an agent.

## Step 1: Create a Project

1. Navigate to **Projects** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Project**
3. Enter your project details:
   - **Name**: My First Project
   - **Repository URL**: Your GitHub repository
   - **Description**: A brief description

## Step 2: Connect Your Repository

OmoiOS needs access to your code repository:

1. Click **Connect GitHub** in project settings
2. Authorize OmoiOS to access your repository
3. Select the branches you want to work with

## Step 3: Create Your First Spec

Specs are the foundation of work in OmoiOS:

1. Navigate to your project's **Specs** tab
2. Click **New Spec**
3. Describe what you want to build:

```
Build a user authentication system with:
- Email/password login
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Rate limiting
```

## Step 4: Watch the Magic

Once you create a spec, OmoiOS will:

1. **Explore** - Research the codebase and understand context
2. **Requirements** - Generate detailed requirements
3. **Design** - Create a technical design
4. **Tasks** - Break down into actionable tasks
5. **Execute** - Deploy agents to implement the solution

## Step 5: Review and Approve

At each phase gate, you can:

- Review the generated artifacts
- Provide feedback
- Approve to continue
- Request changes
