# OmoiOS Launch Plan

*"If your startup isn't growing, you need more marketing than coding."*

---

## Launch Philosophy

Your MVP works minimally — that's enough. Spend one focused week giving it your best shot across every platform. Bugs will surface, and that's feedback. Ship now, fix fast.

## Content Angles (Use Across Platforms)

### Angle 1: The Babysitting Problem
> "I was spending more time checking on my AI than actually working. So I built AI that babysits itself."

### Angle 2: The Spec-Driven Approach
> "Most AI coding tools generate disconnected code. OmoiOS keeps everything traced back to your spec."

### Angle 3: Sleep While Shipping
> "Describe a feature before bed. Wake up to a PR. That's the workflow."

### Angle 4: Continuous Agents + Intelligence
> "Ralph showed us continuous agents work. OmoiOS shows us they need a brain."

### Angle 5: Scaling Without Hiring
> "Your roadmap grows faster than you can hire. OmoiOS lets you scale output without scaling headcount."

### Angle 6: Founder Journey (for Indie Hackers, LinkedIn)
> "I've been building OmoiOS for X months. Here's what I learned about making AI actually useful."

---

## Video Content Ideas (15+ Clips)

### Demo Clips (30-60 sec each)
1. Writing a spec → watching it become tasks
2. DAG visualization in action
3. Multiple agents working in parallel
4. Waking up to a completed PR
5. State checking catching a drift

### Talking Head Clips (15-30 sec each)
6. "The problem with AI coding tools..."
7. "Why I built OmoiOS"
8. "AI should babysit itself"
9. "Describe a feature, wake up to a PR"
10. "Stop checking on your AI"

### Before/After Clips
11. "Before OmoiOS: checking in constantly"
12. "After OmoiOS: reviewing a finished PR"

### Educational Clips
13. "What is a DAG?" (simple explainer)
14. "Continuous agents explained"
15. "Specs as source of truth"

---

## Handling the "It's Buggy" Reality

### In your launch copy, be honest:
> "This is early. There are bugs. But the core idea works — describe a feature, wake up to a PR. I'd rather get it in your hands now than polish forever."

### When bugs get reported:
1. Thank them genuinely
2. Fix fast (or acknowledge timeline)
3. Follow up when fixed
4. Turn bug reporters into champions

### Frame it as early access:
- "Early access" not "beta" (beta sounds unfinished)
- "Founding users" not "testers" (testers sounds like QA)
- "Help shape the product" not "find bugs" (collaborative)

---

## If Week 1 Doesn't Work (The Rebrand Playbook)

Per the advice you shared:

### Step 1: Rebrand
- [ ] New name (or keep OmoiOS, new tagline)
- [ ] New logo
- [ ] New landing page design
- [ ] New headline
- [ ] Same product
- [ ] Repeat Week 1 launch

### Step 2: Pivot Audience
If rebrand doesn't work:
- [ ] Target different segment (solo devs? agencies? specific industry?)
- [ ] Same problem, different market
- [ ] Repeat launch cycle

## Reddit Deep Dive: The Real Playbook

*"Reddit isn't a marketing channel. It's a community of real buyers."*

### Why Reddit Works for Early-Stage

- **No audience required** — A brand new account with a good post can hit 100k views overnight
- **Highest-intent traffic** — Real people with real problems, credit cards ready
- **15-25% DM reply rates** vs 2% cold email
- **Infinite feedback loop** — Users tell you what to build

### Subreddits That Allow Self-Promotion

**Mega (1M+ members):**
- r/InternetIsBeautiful (17M)
- r/Entrepreneur (4.8M)
- r/productivity (4M)
- r/business (2.5M)
- r/smallbusiness (2.2M)
- r/startups (1.8M)

**Large (100k-1M):**
- r/EntrepreneurRideAlong (593K)
- r/SideProject (430K)
- r/Business_Ideas (359K)
- r/SaaS (341K)
- r/thesidehustle (184K)
- r/ycombinator (132K)
- r/indiehackers (91K)
- r/MicroSaas (80K)
- r/GrowthHacking (77K)
- r/growmybusiness (63K)

**Niche (under 100k):**

- r/AlphaandBetaUsers (21K)

**Dev-specific:**
- r/programming (5M+)
- r/webdev (2M+)
- r/artificial (500k+)
- r/devops (300k+)
- r/MachineLearning (2M+)

### The "Undercover Link Drop" Method

**Don't do:** "Check out my new app!"

**Do this instead:**
1. Lead with your struggle (relatable)
2. Share the journey or provide massive value (engaging)
3. Mention your product once, buried in paragraph 3 or 4 (subtle)
4. End with asking for feedback (community-driven)
5. **PUT YOUR LINK IN YOUR BIO** — people will check

**Formula:** 90% value, 10% product mention

### The Comment Link Drop

For subreddits that ban self-promotion in posts:

1. Search Reddit for:
   - "AI coding tool alternative"
   - "continuous agent recommendations"
   - "best tool for autonomous coding"
   - "Devin alternative"
   - "tired of babysitting AI"

2. When you find relevant threads:
   - Answer the question thoroughly first
   - Mention 2-3 competitors honestly
   - Slide yours in naturally: "I also built OmoiOS because I had the same problem"
   - **Never be the first tool you mention**

### The DM Strategy

Posts get visibility. DMs get customers.

1. Find posts where people complain about problems you solve
2. Comment with helpful advice publicly first
3. Wait 24 hours
4. DM:
   > "hey, saw your post about [specific problem]. i actually built something that might help. would you be open to trying it? looking for honest feedback."

5. **No link in the first message. Ever.**

### Best Posting Times

- **8-9am EST** — catches US morning + Europe afternoon
- **7-8pm EST** — evening scrollers
- **Avoid weekends** for B2B/dev content
- **First hour is critical** — engage with every comment immediately

### What Gets You Banned

❌ Links in titles
❌ URL shorteners
❌ New account + immediate self-promo
❌ Same link across multiple subreddits
❌ Deleting and reposting
❌ Asking friends to upvote (Reddit detects this)
❌ Being defensive when criticized

**One ban can blacklist your domain permanently.**

### Content Formats That Work

✅ "How I went from X to Y" (journey posts)
✅ "I analyzed 100 [things] and here's what I found" (data posts)
✅ "The mistakes I made building X" (failure posts)
✅ "AMA: I built a tool that does Y" (engagement posts)

❌ "Introducing [Product Name]"
❌ "We just launched!"
❌ "Check this out"
❌ Anything that sounds like an ad

### The Long Game

6 months of consistent value > 1 viral post

- Comment daily in your niche
- Build genuine relationships
- Become the "helpful person"
- Wait weeks between self-mentions

## The Mindset

You said it yourself: "Look what kind of beautiful things can happen."

Someone is going to use OmoiOS this week and wake up to a PR that works. That's magic. The bugs are temporary. The vision is real.

Ship it. Learn fast. Fix faster.
