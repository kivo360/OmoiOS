## TAGLINE (60 characters max)

**Primary option:**
> Describe a feature. Wake up to a PR.

**Alternatives:**
> AI that babysits itself so you don't have to.

> Stop babysitting AI. Let OmoiOS do it.

> From spec to shipped — while you sleep.

## SHORT DESCRIPTION (260 characters max)

**Primary:**
> Think of Ralph, but with a brain. OmoiOS turns your spec into a DAG, tracks state, runs parallel agents in sandboxes, and constantly checks progress against your goal. Not just "loop until done" — loop until the spec is satisfied. Wake up to a PR.

**Alternative:**
> Continuous agents that actually know where they're going. Write a spec → OmoiOS builds a DAG → parallel agents execute in sandboxes → system constantly checks state against your goal → wake up to shipped code. Like Ralph, but intelligent.

## FULL DESCRIPTION

### The problem with continuous agents

You've probably seen tools like Ralph — continuous agents that loop until the job is done. No prompting, no babysitting. Just "loop until complete."

It's a powerful idea, but there's a problem: **you still end up babysitting.**

Without structure, continuous agents drift. They redo work. They miss dependencies. They don't know when they're *actually* done. So you check in. And check in again. And suddenly you're the babysitter.

### OmoiOS: AI that babysits itself

OmoiOS is the layer that watches your agents so you don't have to:

**1. Helps you build specs**
Don't know where to start? Describe your idea loosely — OmoiOS helps you turn it into a structured spec with requirements, design docs, and acceptance criteria. Your spec becomes the source of truth for your entire app.

**2. Breaks specs into tickets & tasks**
OmoiOS analyzes your spec and generates tickets (features) and atomic tasks with dependencies. You see what will be built, in what order, and why — before any code is written.

**3. DAG-based parallel execution**
Not a for loop — a dependency graph. OmoiOS knows which tasks can run in parallel, which are blocked, and what needs to happen first. Claude Code agents execute tasks in isolated sandboxes — independent work runs simultaneously.

**4. Continuous state checking (the babysitting)**
OmoiOS constantly compares current state against your spec. Did this task actually achieve what it was supposed to? Are we closer to the goal? Are agents stuck or spinning? OmoiOS watches so you don't have to.

**5. Self-correction & discovery**
When agents hit issues, OmoiOS adapts. When they discover missing requirements, new tickets and tasks get added to the DAG. The system evolves toward your goal, not just through a checklist.

### The difference

| Simple continuous agents (like Ralph) | OmoiOS |
|---------------------------------------|--------|
| You write the tasks | Helps you build specs, generates tickets & tasks |
| Loops until done | Knows what "done" means (checks against spec) |
| Sequential execution | DAG-based parallel execution |
| Retries on failure | Adapts and discovers new work |
| You babysit | OmoiOS babysits for you |

### What you get

- **Spec building** — OmoiOS helps you create structured specs from loose ideas
- **Automatic ticket & task generation** — Specs become trackable work with dependencies
- **Parallel execution** — Multiple agents working simultaneously on independent tasks
- **AI babysits itself** — OmoiOS watches agents, checks progress, catches drift — so you don't have to
- **Wake up to PRs** — Describe a feature before bed, review code in the morning

### Perfect for

- **Anyone tired of babysitting AI** — This is literally what OmoiOS does for you
- **CTOs & Founders** — Scale output without scaling headcount (or your own attention)
- **Devs who've tried continuous agents** — Get the oversight layer you've been doing manually

### Pricing

- **Free** — 1 agent, 5 workflows/month
- **Pro ($50/mo)** — 5 concurrent agents, 100 workflows
- **Team ($150/mo)** — 10 agents, 500 workflows, team collaboration

## FIRST COMMENT (Maker's Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Kevin. I've been obsessed with continuous agents — the idea that an AI can just "loop until done" without constant prompting. Tools like Ralph showed the potential.

But I kept running into the same problem: **the agent doesn't know where it's going.**

A continuous loop is powerful, but without structure:

- Agents redo work they already did
- They miss dependencies between tasks
- They don't know when they're *actually* done
- They can't tell you how close they are to the goal

**So I built OmoiOS — continuous agents with a brain.**

Here's how it works:

1. **Describe your idea** — Even loosely. OmoiOS helps you turn it into a structured spec.
2. **OmoiOS generates tickets & tasks** — With dependencies, forming a DAG
3. **Claude Code agents execute in parallel sandboxes** — Multiple agents working simultaneously
4. **System constantly checks state against spec** — Are we closer? Is this task actually done?
5. **Wake up to a PR** — Everything traced back to your original intent

The key insight: **AI should babysit itself**. OmoiOS doesn't just track tasks — it watches agents, catches drift, checks progress against your spec, and course-corrects. You shouldn't have to do that. That's the job.

If you've tried AI coding tools and found yourself constantly checking in, this is the fix. OmoiOS babysits so you can actually walk away.

Try it free — connect your GitHub and see what happens overnight.

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

**vs. Simple continuous agents (Ralph, etc.):**
"Those are the engine. OmoiOS is the navigation. They loop; OmoiOS knows where you're going, tracks progress, and handles the complexity of parallel execution and dependencies."

**vs. Devin / other autonomous agents:**
"Most autonomous agents are black boxes. OmoiOS is spec-driven — you approve the plan, you see the DAG, every task traces back to requirements. Full visibility into what's happening and why."

**vs. Copilot / Cursor:**
"Copilot helps you write code faster in the moment. OmoiOS executes entire features autonomously. You describe what you want, approve the DAG, and walk away."

**vs. just writing a script:**
"A script runs tasks in order. OmoiOS builds a dependency graph, runs independent tasks in parallel, constantly checks state against your goal, and adapts when things change."

## FAQ RESPONSES

**Q: Is this like Ralph?**
A: Similar concept — continuous agents that loop until done. But OmoiOS adds the intelligence layer: DAG-based execution, state checking against specs, parallel agents. Ralph is a for loop; OmoiOS knows where it's going.

**Q: What makes this different from other AI coding tools?**
A: Specs as source of truth. OmoiOS doesn't just generate code — it understands your goal, builds a plan, and constantly measures progress. Everything traces back to your spec.

**Q: How does the DAG work?**
A: OmoiOS analyzes your spec and breaks it into tasks with dependencies. Tasks that don't depend on each other run in parallel. When one task completes, dependent tasks automatically unblock.

**Q: What if agents make mistakes?**
A: OmoiOS constantly checks state against your spec. If something's wrong, it adapts — retry, take a different approach, or flag for human review. It's not just "loop until no errors."

**Q: Is my code safe?**
A: Agents run in isolated sandboxes. Your code stays in your GitHub repo. We don't store your source code.
